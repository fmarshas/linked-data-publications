        "abstract": "Emerging data driven economy including industry, research and business, requires new types of specialists that are capable to support all stages of the data lifecycle from data production and input to data processing and actionable results delivery, visualisation and reporting, which can be jointly defined as the Data Science professions family. Data Science is becoming a new recognised field of science that leverages the Data Analytics methods with the power of the Big Data technologies and Cloud Computing that both provide a basis for effective use of the data driven research and economy models. Data Science research and education require a multi-disciplinary approach and data driven/centric paradigm shift. Besides core professional competences and knowledge in Data Science, increasing digitalisation of Science and Industry also requires new type of workplace and professional skills that rise the importance of critical thinking, problem solving and creativity required to work in highly automated and dynamic environment. The education and training of the data related professions must reflect all multi-disciplinary knowledge and competences that are required from the Data Science and handling practitioners in modern, data driven research and the digital economy. In modern conditions with the fast technology change and strong skills demand, the Data Science education and training should be customizable and delivered in multiple forms, also providing sufficient lab facilities for practical training. This paper discusses aspects of building customizable and interoperable Data Science curricula for different types of learners and target application domains. The proposed approach is based on using the EDISON Data Science Framework (EDSF) initially developed in the EU funded Project EDISON and currently being maintained by the EDISON Community Initiative.",

My talk will illustrate how these tools work in seven tasks: 1. Encoding causal assumptions in transparent and testable way 2. Predicting the effects of actions and policies 3. Computing counterfactuals and finding causes of effects 4. Computing direct and indirect effects (Mediation) 5. Integrating data from diverse sources. 6. Recovering from missing data 7. Discovering causal relations from data.

In our previous efforts, we have developed a semantic data integration and search software tool named OmniSearch [1], which was specifically designed for the microRNA (miRNA or miR) domain. OmniSearch has been successfully applied in numerous biomedical and clinical areas [2-5] such as: chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) and lung cancer (LC), diabetes and diabetic kidney disease (DKD), osteoarthritis (OA), glioblastoma (GBM), and pediatric acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL). We are currently working on OmniSearch Plus, which was extended from OmniSearch and will cover important non-coding RNA (ncRNA) molecules other than miRNAs, including long ncRNAs (lncRNAs), small nuclear RNAs (snRNAs), and small nucleolar RNAs (snoRNAs).",

Rapid development of Information and Communication Technology (ICT) in this era is very significant due to increasing number of users accessing data keeps growing by the time. This phenomenon has been coined as big data. What is Big data??? We address big data as assets that needs unique platform to deal with bizarre behavior of datasets whose size is beyond the ability of typical data storage to manage, mine and analyze accordingly. This bizarre behavior requires three main personalities: volume, velocity, and variety that basically need new architecture, techniques, algorithms, and analytics to uncover the golden and hidden knowledge from information obesity. From these perspectives, we demonstrate our experiences in setting up our Data Science/Big Data platform, algorithms and tool to align with big data plug and play within the academic environment as well as our services to the community and industries.",

However, the current DA is a sort of a deductive modeling method strongly depending on given simulation models, so that it never extracts, from big data, information that is beyond a priori assumptions of the simulation models. The present tutorial paper discusses the limitation of the current DA, and indicates an orientation how to implement data-driven modeling methods on DA procedure. Sparse modeling such as lasso has a potential to realize this, although specific methods are still under investigation.",

        "abstract": "As more and more companies are embracing Big data, it has become apparent that the ultimate challenge is to relate massive amounts of event data to processes that are highly dynamic. To unleash the value of event data, events need to be tightly connected to the control and management of operational processes. However, the primary focus of Big data technologies is currently on storage, processing, and rather simple analytical tasks. Big data initiatives rarely focus on the improvement of end-to-end processes. To address this mismatch, we advocate a better integration of data science, data technology and process science. Data science approaches tend to be process agonistic whereas process science approaches tend to be model-driven without considering the “evidence” hidden in the data. Process mining aims to bridge this gap. This editorial discusses the interplay between data science and process science and relates process mining to Big data technologies, service orientation, and cloud computing.",

        "abstract": "Data Science is an emerging field of science, which requires a multi-disciplinary approach and should be built with a strong link to emerging Big Data and data driven technologies, and consequently needs re-thinking and re-design of both traditional educational models and existing courses. The education and training of Data Scientists currently lacks a commonly accepted, harmonized instructional model that reflects by design the whole lifecycle of data handling in modern, data driven research and the digital economy. This paper presents the EDISON Data Science Framework (EDSF) that is intended to create a foundation for the Data Science profession definition. The EDSF includes the following core components: Data Science Competence Framework (CF-DS), Data Science Body of Knowledge (DS-BoK), Data Science Model Curriculum (MC-DS), and Data Science Professional profiles (DSP profiles). The MC-DS is built based on CF-DS and DS-BoK, where Learning Outcomes are defined based on CF-DS competences and Learning Units are mapped to Knowledge Units in DS-BoK. In its own turn, Learning Units are defined based on the ACM Classification of Computer Science (CCS2012) and reflect typical courses naming used by universities in their current programmes. The paper provides example how the proposed EDSF can be used for designing effective Data Science curricula and reports the experience of implementing EDSF by the Champion Universities that cooperate with the EDISON project.",

Although ethics can help data scientists reflect on certain normative aspects of their work, such efforts are ill-equipped to generate a data science that avoids social harms and promotes social justice. In this article, I argue that data science must embrace a political orientation. Data scientists must recognize themselves as political actors engaged in normative constructions of society and evaluate their work according to its downstream impacts on people&#x0027;s lives. I first articulate why data scientists must recognize themselves as political actors. In this section, I respond to three arguments that data scientists commonly invoke when challenged to take political positions regarding their work. In confronting these arguments, I describe why attempting to remain apolitical is itself a political stance&#x2014;a fundamentally conservative one&#x2014;and why data science&#x0027;s attempts to promote &#x201C;social good&#x201D; dangerously rely on unarticulated and incrementalist political assumptions. I then propose a framework for how data science can evolve toward a deliberative and rigorous politics of social justice. I conceptualize the process of developing a politically engaged data science as a sequence of four stages. Pursuing these new approaches will empower data scientists with new methods for thoughtfully and rigorously contributing to social justice.",

        "abstract": "This paper first reviews the benefits of well-defined roles and then discusses the current lack of standardized roles within the data science community, perhaps due to the newness of the field. Specifically, the paper reports on five case studies exploring five different attempts to define a standard set of roles. These case studies explore the usage of roles from an industry perspective as well as from national standard big data committee efforts. The paper then leverages the results of these case studies to explore the use of data science roles within online job postings. While some roles appeared frequently, such as data scientist and data engineer, no role was consistently used across all five case studies. Hence, the paper concludes by noting the need to create a data science workforce framework that could be used by students, employers, and academic institutions. This framework would enable organizations to staff their data science teams more accurately with the desired skillsets.",

        "abstract": "Increasingly larger number of software systems today are including data science components for descriptive, predictive, and prescriptive analytics. The collection of data science stages from acquisition, to cleaning/curation, to modeling, and so on are referred to as data science pipelines. To facilitate research and practice on data science pipelines, it is essential to understand their nature. What are the typical stages of a data science pipeline? How are they connected? Do the pipelines differ in the theoretical representations and that in the practice? Today we do not fully understand these architectural characteristics of data science pipelines. In this work, we present a three-pronged comprehensive study to answer this for the state-of-the-art, data science in-the-small, and data science in-the-large, Our study analyzes three datasets: a collection of 71 proposals for data science pipelines and related concepts in theory, a collection of over 105 implementations of curated data science pipelines from Kaggle competitions to understand data science in-the-small, and a collection of 21 mature data science projects from GitHub to understand data science in-the-large. Our study has led to three representations of data science pipelines that capture the essence of our subjects in theory, in-the-small, and in-the-large.",

        "abstract": "Data Science is becoming a field connecting multi-year development in areas such as Big Data and Data Analytics, and also applied domains like Bioengineering. Data Science education programs are rapidly being created on all levels. Usually it happens through reuse or renaming and can result in curricula that lack proper balance of competences, which balance is necessary for future data scientists. Our quantitative analysis of over 300 programs worldwide shows that at least one of the three core data science competence groups is under-represented in the majority of programs. Moreover, general business courses are often suggested to students to cover the domain competence group, which in most cases results in superficial treatment of this competence group. Our further qualitative analysis demonstrates that learning outcomes for most of the courses are usually not defined or defined improperly.",

A paradigm based on composition of data rich services to gather data to replicate real world scenarios through complexity science based simulators, where quality of data as well as theories explaining them is primarily assured via building and testing of hypotheses, can improve our understanding of what we try to comprehend by engaging data science. While simulators would at least partially automate the implementation of scientific method, a credibility ranking mechanism, would not only help determining and disseminating rankings pertaining to the quality of data as well as theories explaining them but also receive & publish feedback regarding rankings. Including methods used in complex system analysis as part of simulators would enhance the scientific rigor of establishing the credibility of knowledge we have. Providing simulation as a service and making graphical hypothesis builders & testers available for external parties (sometimes even members of general public) would democratice the process of ascertaining the believability of data & associated theoretical models thereby further enhancing the Quality of Knowledge.",

        "abstract": "One role of universities is to provide students with the practical knowledge necessary to address broad societal needs. The growing field of data science has the potential to address many of these needs, primarily due to recent efforts to collect large amounts of data related to social, environmental, and political issues. A challenge is that there exists a disconnect between these real-world issues and the course materials taught to university students. This gap is due in part to a lack of engagement between universities and their local communities, leaving students with few opportunities to work with datasets relevant to real-world problems. To address this disconnect, the authors have implemented a novel data science education and outreach program in which students acquire new knowledge and skills while creating positive social impact through community service. In this work, we outline this outreach program, the Michigan Data Science Team, and provide empirical evidence of positive educational and social impact.",

MC-DS follows a competence-based curriculum design approach grounded in the Data Science competences (CD-DS) defined in EDSF and correspondingly defined Learning Outcomes (LO). The DSBoK provides a basis for structuring the proposed MC-DS by Knowledge Area Groups (KAG) defined in correspondence with the CF-DS competence groups. ECTS point allocation to specific areas is recommended for Master's and Bachelor's program covering professional profile groups.",

        "abstract": "The overarching goal of this research was to gain an understanding of what the data science Reddit online community discussed before, during, and after COVID-19. We used a publicly available Reddit API to harvest the r/datascience subreddit first level post data. We then performed manual annotation to explore the taxonomy of trends and themes discussed by the practitioners who belonged to reddit data science community. Then, we augmented the manually annotated data using a BERT model with topic modeling. In short, the key discussion themes, in order of frequency, were: Education, Jobs, Methods (of data science), Hardware and data collection, Data visualization, and Quality. The Quality theme includes discussions on bias, transparency, and fairness. Hence, a key finding was that there were very few discussions on data science project quality, especially trying to minimize the risk of machine learning bias. As discussions on bias are not yet common, data science teams should proactively identify and address potential questions and concerns that might arise in data science projects, especially the need to increase the team’s focus on potential bias and fairness.",

Without an evaluation framework, it is difficult for data science teams to understand their team process strengths and weaknesses. To help address this challenge, this exploratory research, via a Delpha study, identified nine key questions a data science team could answer to help evaluate their process. In short, the study identified questions evaluating the team’s communication (within the team and with stakeholders). The study also identified team process questions (e.g., the use of iterations, life cycles and a prioritization process for potential tasks). Future research could explore how data science teams can best improve their process by leveraging and refining these questions as well as defining an overall data science project management evaluation framework.",

We believe data science and AI will change the world. No matter how smart and powerful an AI model we can build, the ultimate testimony of the success of data science and AI is users’ trust. How can we build trustworthy data science? At the level of user-model interaction, how can we convince users that a data analytic result is trustworthy? At the level of group-wise collaboration for data science and AI, how can we ensure that the parties and their contributions are recognized fairly, and establish trust between the outcome (e.g., a model built) of the group collaboration and the external users? At the level of data science participant eco-systems, how can we effectively and efficiently connect many participants of various roles and facilitate the connection among supplies and demands of data and models? In this talk, I will brainstorm possible directions to the above questions in the context of an endto-end data science pipeline. To strengthen trustworthy interactions between models and users, I will advocate exact and consistent interpretation of machine learning models. Our recent results show that exact and consistent interpretations are not just theoretically feasible, but also practical even for API-based AI services. To build trust in collaboration among multiple participants in coalition, I will review some progress in ensuring fairness in federated learning, including fair assessment of contributions and fairness enforcement in collaboration outcome. Last, to address the need of trustworthy data science eco-systems, I will review some latest efforts in building data and model marketplaces and preserving fairness and privacy. Through reflection I will discuss some challenges and opportunities in building trustworthy data science for possible future work.",

In my talk, I will describe the work that we have done as Commissioner on AI and COVID-19 for the President of the Valencian Region. Since March 2020, I have been leading a multi-disciplinary team of 20+ volunteer scientists been working on 4 large areas: (1) human mobility modeling; (2) computational epidemiological models (both metapopulation, individual and LSTM-based models); (3) predictive models; and (4) citizen surveys via the COVID19impactsurvey (https://covid19impactsurvey.org) with over 500,000 answers worldwide. I will describe the results that we have produced in each of these areas and will share the lessons learned in this very special initiative of collaboration between the civil society at large (through the survey), the scientific community (through the Expert Group) and a public administration (through the Commissioner at the Presidency level).",

The NPP SDS performs research and data product assessment while using a fully distributed architecture. The components of this architecture are organized around key environmental data disciplines: land, ocean, ozone, atmospheric sounding, and atmospheric composition. The SDS thus establishes a set of concepts and a working prototypes. This paper describes the framework used by the NPP Project as it enabled Measurement-Based Earth Science Data Systems for the assessment of NPP products.",

To realize these, we are designing a data platform that consists of about ten interconnected subsystems. We aim to incorporate next generation repository (NGR) concepts into our platform; the subsystems share features such as persistent identifier (PID) based resource management, a common metadata model, and vocabulary control. Another vital requirement is that all datasets must be machine-readable and translatable. These features are highly important in developing a platform as a research pipeline capable of handling various materials data - from data creation and efficient collection, to advanced data usage, secure storage, and open publishing.",

        "abstract": "Workflow systems manage large-scale experiments and deliver a large volume of provenance data traces. The provenance repository of these systems contains information about the workflow execution, which allows for tracking and analyzing data transformations. However, provenance data may still be considered a black-box, when it comes to analyze the contents of resulting data files. Current solutions are focused on data transformation at coarse grain, they point to input and output files, but do not allow for exploring domain-specific data. Data analytics is essential for managing large-scale workflows executed in parallel, especially when tracking anomalous executions. In this paper, we present a data analytics approach, which is based on the use of provenance data enriched with domain-specific data coupled to a data mining tool. A real bioinformatics workflow was modeled and executed in parallel on top of Amazon clouds. It manipulates complex biological data, which is difficult to monitor like many other genomic workflows. We evaluate the benefits of using domain-specific data and provenance data for user steering while monitoring the execution with detailed filters, steering on specific conditions and performance evaluation. Results show that the provenance database coupled to workflow systems has an unexplored potential for raw data analytics, which may improve the user confidence and reduce overall execution time.",

While these topics are interesting in their own right, perhaps the most compelling aspect of these fields is how the tools, which are in widespread use, have been developed by an Open Source community. Individuals across several universities and companies have worked together in a distributed fashion to build and improve the leading generation of data technologies. These Open Source principles have enabled the latest industry-adopted tools to constantly evolve at an incredible rate. One way for educators to keep pace with these developments and maintain advanced curriculum is to adopt the same collaborative principles used in open source. At the Insight Data Fellowship, we've used this open source model to provide immediate feedback and drive our curriculum forward, while fostering a culture of independence and curiosity. This session will show Engineering educators how to use open source principles and tools to develop their own curriculum.",

While these policies spark the promise of transparency, an open data program is an effective gateway to a larger data and technology strategy. Governments can use portals to convene a tech community consisting of entrepreneurs, professionals in information technology from large enterprises, and civic activists. The blend of the technology components and grassroots culture is necessary for governments to function as a platform. Yet, open data can achieve more than transparency and GaaP services. By leveraging open data and applying the principles of open access and open science, governments can collaborate with external researchers to implement analytic, stochastic research models that improve the efficiency of city operations and help advise on data-driven policy. Governments can leverage technologies such as open source software and distributed version control to share research with others, inviting review through reproducible research and also inviting improvements. In order to be successful, there must be a alignment between the governments internal technology stack and it's edifice to the public. We will discuss lessons from building a broad data strategy inclusive of open data, advanced analytics a la open science, internal technology systems, and necessary culture to iterate toward an collaboration between governments, the public, researchers, and private enterprise.?",

        "abstract": "Doing data science - extracting insight by analyzing data - is not easy. Data science is used to answer interesting questions that typically involve multiple diverse data sources, many different types of analysis, and often, large and messy data volumes. To answer one of these questions, several types of expertise may be needed to understand the context and domain being served, to import and transform individual data sets, to implement effective machine learning and/or statistical methods, to design and program applications and interfaces to extract and share data and insights, and to manage the data and systems used for analysis and storage. In the IBM Research Accelerated Discovery Lab, we are studying how data scientists work, and using what we learn to help them gain insights faster. In this talk, we will look at what we have learned to date, through user studies and experience with tens of analytics projects, and the environment that we’ve built as a result. In particular, I will describe how we capture information to enable contextual search, provenance queries, and other functionality to afford teams faster progress in data-intensive investigations. I will also touch on our efforts to leverage data and people to explain what happens during an investigation, with an ultimate goal of moving from descriptive to prescriptive analytics in order to accelerate data science and the analytic process. I will illustrate these various efforts using an ambitious current project on applying metagenomics to food safety, and will conclude with a discussion of where more work is needed and our future directions.",

Companies these days have realized the importance of data management and therefore are recruiting staff as data scientists and academics institutions and publications have accepted data science as one the trending career options. The current era of IT industry is evolving very rapidly. With the growing requirement of IT sector the demand of each sub-unit is also developing with huge pace. Introduction of distributed computing had resolved the issues of the industry but now analyzing the growth pace the requirements will be drastically challenging for the industry, organisations as well as society. If we want this science to serve and promote business effectively, it is important for us (i) to recognize its associations to other important technologies and concepts, and (ii) to initiate the classify the fundamental ideologies underlying data science. This paper has a systematic overview on data science, its application and its interactions to other important related perceptions. The combination of data science and distributed computing can resolve many issues of the industry.",

        "abstract": "The collection, storage, manipulation, analysis, and retention of massive amounts of data have resulted in new technologies including big data analytics and data science. It is now possible to analyse massive amounts of data and extract useful nuggets. However, the collection and manipulation of this data has also resulted in serious security and privacy considerations. Various regulations are being proposed to handle big data so that the privacy of the individuals is not violated. Furthermore, the massive amounts of data being stored may also be vulnerable to cyber attacks. Big Data, Data Science and Security are being integrated to solve many of the security and privacy challenges. For example, machine learning techniques are being applied to solve security problems such as malware analysis and insider threat detection. However, there is also a major concern that the machine learning techniques themselves could be attacked. Therefore, the machine learning techniques are being adapted to handle adversarial attacks. This area is known as adversarial machine learning. In addition, privacy of the individuals is also being violated through these machine learning techniques as it is now possible to gather and analyse vast amounts of data and therefore privacy enhanced data science techniques are being developed. With the advent of the web, computing systems are now being used in every aspect of our lives from mobile phones to autonomous vehicles. It is now possible to collect, store, manage, and analyse vast amounts of sensor data emanating from numerous devices and sensors including from various transportation systems. Such systems collectively are known as the Internet of Transportation, which is essentially the Internet of Things for Transportation, where multiple autonomous transportation systems are connected through the web and coordinate their activities. However, security and privacy for the Internet of Transportation and the infrastructures that support it is a challenge. Due to the large volumes of heterogenous data being collected from numerous devices, the traditional cyber security techniques such as encryption are not efficient to secure the Internet of Transportation. Some Physics-based solutions being developed are showing promise. More recently, the developments in Data Science are also being examined for securing the Internet of Transportation and its supporting infrastructures. To assess the developments on the integration of Big Data, Data Science and Security over the past decade and apply them to the Internet of Transportation, the presentation will focus on three aspects. First it will examine the developments on applying Data Science techniques for detecting cyber security problems such as insider threat detection as well as the advances in adversarial machine learning. Some developments on privacy aware and policy-based data management frameworks will also be discussed. Second it will discuss the developments on securing the Internet of Transportation and its supporting infrastructures and examine the privacy implications. Finally, it will describe ways in which Big Data, Data Science and Security could be incorporated into the Internet of Transportation and Infrastructures.",

The real work of the chief analytics officer (CAO) involves acquiring enough data science talent and getting the right organizational structure in place so the overall team of data scientists (and the organization as a whole) is most effective in turning data into information, making better decisions, and building organizational capabilities. The CAO must have the trust of senior executives if this is to happen, so building that trust, and cultivating personal gravitas, is his or her most important job. The CAO should report as high into the company as possible. He or she will also lead a contingent of data scientists, variously placed according to their roles. The real work of the CAO involves adjusting the organizational structure more or less continuously, as everything in the data space is in continuous flux.",

It was launched onboard the NASA Earth Observing System (EOS) Terra satellite in December 1999. MOPITT data products are archived and distributed by the Atmospheric Sciences Data Center (ASDC) at NASA's Langley Research Center. Available MOPITT data products include Level 1 radiances and Level 2 derived carbon monoxide total column and mixing ratio profiles at a horizontal resolution of about 22 km at nadir and a vertical resolution of about 4 km. The ASDC also makes available tools that aid in the visualization and analysis of the MOPITT Level 2 data products. The MOPITT L2 Viewer software package plots images from the MOPITT Level 2 data files. Sample read software extracts data from a MOPITT Level 2 HDF-EOS formatted file and outputs the data in ASCII. The software also allows subsetting by latitude and longitude. Detailed information about the MOPITT data products, tools and documentation is available from the ASDC web site.",

        "abstract": "Big data is an emerging phenomenon characterized by the three Vs: volume, velocity, and variety. The volume of data has increased from terabytes to petabytes and is encroaching on exabytes. Some pundits are suggesting that zettabytes (1021) are reachable within the next several years. Velocity is concerned with not only how fast we accumulate data, but also how fast some of the data that we already have is changing. Some systems accumulate data at the rate of multiple petabytes per year, some systems have stored data that changes at the rate of terabytes per year. Changing data usually lags accumulating data by several orders of magnitude. Data accumulating at a multiple petabyte rate requires terabits to petabits of transport capacity. Finally, the variety and modality of data is continually evolving, it may be both structured and unstructured.",

        "abstract": "Recently, “cloud computing” has become an attractive paradigm for the administration and provisioning of internet-based services. This paradigm is known as “cloud computing.” The promise of this being a reality has been around for a while, but cloud computing has risen to meet the shifting conditions of the IT industry. In this article, we introduce the trust model, the suffrage heuristic, the Heterogeneous Earliest Finish Time (HEFT) scheduling algorithm, and the trust value computation. The trust model has parameters that vary with values of sub parameters and the tasks they perform. These functions are regarded as a standard of durability and cannot be broken. The assumption that better mappings can be made by allocating a resource or machine whose expected time of completion will suffer if that machine is not allocated is the foundation around which a suffrage heuristic will be built. Due to its great performance and stability across a variety of graph topologies, the HEFT technique is a promising solution for the Directed Acyclic Graph (DAG) and associated scheduling problem on the heterogeneous systems. The average schedule length is longer in the suffrage without trust scenario compared to the HEFT without trust, suffrage with trust, and the HEFT with trust scenarios. It is possible that there is no algorithm that, given a scheduling problem, can produce a best solution in polynomial time. Utilising random variables to find solutions to scheduling issues calls for the application of a stochastic approach as well. In addition to swarm algorithms and evolutionary algorithms, these strategies made use of Simulated Annealing (SA). The initial goal of the effort was to use a GA, and then the Firefly Algorithm (FA), to optimise the cost and performance of workflow scheduling. Algorithms like the HEFT and the GA have been proposed in this work. For applications utilising a finite set of heterogeneous processors, this HEFT serves as the underlying algorithm. We can use the GAs to find a global optimum for issues with a large and irregular search space.",

        "abstract": "In the context of decarbonization and fossil fuel independence, Chile has a great task ahead. The most relevant is to become carbon neutral by 2050 by replacing fossil fuels with clean energy sources, where, besides hydraulics, solar and wind power are the chosen ones. However, the commitment to rely on intermittent sources requires a variety of studies to support the roadmap and the success of this decarbonization plan. Therefore, this study aims to understand the behavior of the energy mix and its sources by analyzing the historical production data according to the geographical context. This way, as a starting point, it was possible to discover the main behaviors and patterns, such as the electric sources’ trends and seasonalities that explain the use of fossil fuels. To this end, data science tools were used for the exploration of big data, their respective analysis, and subsequent projections for planning the energy matrix’s decarbonization process for 2050.",

        "abstract": "The collection, storage, manipulation, analysis, and retention of massive amounts of data have resulted in new technologies including big data analytics and data science. It is now possible to analyse massive amounts of data and extract useful nuggets. However, the collection and manipulation of this data has also resulted in serious security and privacy considerations. Various regulations are being proposed to handle big data so that the privacy of the individuals is not violated. Furthermore, the massive amounts of data being stored may also be vulnerable to cyber attacks. Big Data, Data Science and Security are being integrated to solve many of the security and privacy challenges. For example, machine learning techniques are being applied to solve security problems such as malware analysis and insider threat detection. However, there is also a major concern that the machine learning techniques themselves could be attacked. Therefore, the machine learning techniques are being adapted to handle adversarial attacks. This area is known as adversarial machine learning. In addition, privacy of the individuals is also being violated through these machine learning techniques as it is now possible to gather and analyse vast amounts of data and therefore privacy enhanced data science techniques are being developed. With the advent of the web, computing systems are now being used in every aspect of our lives from mobile phones to autonomous vehicles. It is now possible to collect, store, manage, and analyse vast amounts of sensor data emanating from numerous devices and sensors including from various transportation systems. Such systems collectively are known as the Internet of Transportation, which is essentially the Internet of Things for Transportation, where multiple autonomous transportation systems are connected through the web and coordinate their activities. However, security and privacy for the Internet of Transportation and the infrastructures that support it is a challenge. Due to the large volumes of heterogenous data being collected from numerous devices, the traditional cyber security techniques such as encryption are not efficient to secure the Internet of Transportation. Some Physics-based solutions being developed are showing promise. More recently, the developments in Data Science are also being examined for securing the Internet of Transportation and its supporting infrastructures. To assess the developments on the integration of Big Data, Data Science and Security over the past decade and apply them to the Internet of Transportation, the presentation will focus on three aspects. First it will examine the developments on applying Data Science techniques for detecting cyber security problems such as insider threat detection as well as the advances in adversarial machine learning. Some developments on privacy aware and policy-based data management frameworks will also be discussed. Second it will discuss the developments on securing the Internet of Transportation and its supporting infrastructures and examine the privacy implications. Finally, it will describe ways in which Big Data, Data Science and Security could be incorporated into the Internet of Transportation and Infrastructures.",

        "abstract": "The hierarchy of human knowledge is categorized at the levels of data, information, knowledge, and intelligence. For instance, given an AND-gate with 1,000-input pins, it may be described very much differently at various levels of perceptions in the knowledge hierarchy. At the data level on the bottom, it represents a 21,000 state space, known as ‘big data’ in recent terms, which appears to be a big issue in engineering. However, at the information level, it just represents 1,000 bit information that is equivalent to the numbers of inputs. Further, at the knowledge level, it expresses only two rules that if all inputs are one, the output is one; and if any input is zero, the output is zero. Ultimately, at the intelligence level, it is simply an instance of the logical model of an AND-gate with arbitrary inputs. This problem reveals that human intelligence and wisdom are an extremely efficient and a fast convergent induction mechanism for knowledge and wisdom elicitation and abstraction where data are merely factual materials and arbitrary instances in the almost infinite state space of the real world. Although data and information processing have been relatively well studied, the nature, theories, and suitable mathematics underpinning knowledge and intelligence are yet to be systematically studied in cognitive informatics and cognitive computing. This will leads to a new era of human intelligence revolution following the industrial, computational, and information revolutions. This is also in accordance with the driving force of the hierarchical human needs from low-level material requirements to high-level ones such as knowledge, wisdom, and intelligence. The trend to the emerging intelligent revolution is to meet the ultimate human needs. The basic approach to intelligent revolution is to invent and embody cognitive computers, cognitive robots, and cognitive systems that extend human memory capacity, learning ability, wisdom, and creativity. Via intelligence revolution, an interconnected cognitive intelligent Internet will enable ordinary people to access highly intelligent systems created based on the latest development of human knowledge and wisdom. Highly professional systems may help people to solve typical everyday problems. Towards these objectives, the latest advances in abstract intelligence and intelligence science investigated in cognitive informatics and cognitive computing are well positioned at the center of intelligence revolution. A wide range of applications of cognitive computers have been developing in ICIC [http://www.ucalgary.ca/icic/] such as, inter alia, cognitive computers, cognitive robots, cognitive learning engines, cognitive Internet, cognitive agents, cognitive search engines, cognitive translators, cognitive control systems, cognitive communications systems, and cognitive automobiles.",

Based on the theoretical knowledge of network and data sciences, researchers need to be familiar with relevant future technologies. There are several compacting network science approaches that are available quantities research. Data science tools and network science approaches offer a unique perspective to tackle complex problems, impenetrable to linear-proportional thinking. So, in this study, we reviewed various network graph-based analytics such as network centrality, closeness centrality as a necessity for the internet of things-based technologies. Also, we discussed a few top data analytics and visualization tools for these technologies as well. Finally, we performed a comparison of network metrics along with suitable platforms.",

        "abstract": "This Research-to-Practice Work in Progress paper presents a recent professional development for high school computer science teachers. The court system increasingly relies on algorithms to rate a criminal defendant's likelihood of recidivism. These algorithms utilize machine learning models tuned on biased datasets, resulting in false assessments. There are several other alerting examples of how a software engineer's personal bias affects their design and development of technology. This bias leads to poor usability of technology for underserved groups. Data science applies machine learning on massive datasets to invent new technology to improve everyday life from healthcare to consumer needs. Designing and developing data science solutions for a diverse population requires an unbiased approach. Data feminism, which emerges from the intersecting fields of data science and feminist theory, presents a methodology to solve data science problems given three principles: 1) invent new ways to represent data unknowns, 2) invent new ways to reference the material economy behind the data, 3) make dissent possible. In this paper, we present a case study on a week-long online professional development for computer science high school teachers on data science using a data feminist lens. We discuss the data science tools and technology taught during the weeklong event. We share examples of the data feminism principles and class exercises. The computer science teachers also participated in community building activities. The culminating weeklong challenge was to analyze an earthquake dataset, which included themes of socioeconomic disparity within a city. The teachers worked in teams to explore this dataset with the new data science techniques and recommend resource management solutions for a city's earthquake response. In this paper, we explore the question: how the participating computer science high school teachers incorporate data feminism into their data science pipeline? We analyze the audio transcripts collected during the week to create visual analytics on our findings. We consider the impacts of culturally responsive approaches to computer science K-12 curriculum and future professional development in this space.",

The SCIDIP-ES project addresses the long-term persistent storage, access and management needs of scientific data by providing preservation infrastructure services. Taking exemplars from the Earth Science domain we highlight the key preservation challenges and barriers to be overcome by the SCIDIP-ES infrastructure. SCIDIP-ES augments existing science data e-infrastructures by adding specific services and toolkits, which implement core preservation concepts, thus guaranteeing the long-term access to data assets across and beyond their designated communities.",

This growth indicates a recognition of the critical role that data plays in shaping our understanding of complex issues in today's data-driven society. It also underscores the need for data science education to be accessible, representative, and tailored to a wide array of learners and professionals. The work to date to establish a data science foundational knowledge framework represents a pivotal step in formalizing and enhancing data science education. Yet, these frameworks have been largely designed for those pursuing data science careers. The field is in need of a data science framework that focuses on the essential introductory knowledge and skills for non-CS students to build a solid foundation in data science. This paper provides a description of the literature review process and experiences the research team has drawn from to develop such a framework. It also positions this framework for future research in studying effectiveness and alignment to the K-12 space.",

The major problem is to develop a method which works exactly the way how a human brain works. The architecture of artificial intelligence must emphasize on evaluation and redesign the nature of design process. Data science is also trending now and analytically deals to solve complex problems. Data is divided into smaller parts and its trends, behaviors are understood. The main problem in data science is to handle large quantities of data. Though there is significant increase in terms of research opportunities few challenges like lack of compute power, people power still remains a big challenge.",

Data science results depend upon the quality of data been extracted. The objective of this research paper is to implement a federated query processing framework which extracts data from different data sources and stores the result datasets in a common in-memory data format. This helps data scientists to perform their analysis and execute machine learning algorithms using different data engines without having to convert the data into their native data format and improve the performance.",

        "abstract": "Sustainable manufacturing is of increasing interest to a large number of batch production facilities. Energy efficiencies achieved through optimized scheduling is a desired target for such facilities. To achieve these energy efficiencies, the initial step is accurately modelling plant energy profiles from historical production schedule data. This poses several challenges as the data required to model plant energy is stored in various sources and does not conform to a common sampling rate or data type. Also, separating the energy consumption caused by plant production from the base load of lighting and HVAC systems is difficult unless each production process is metered adequately. This paper focuses on developing a methodology to deal with the complexities of data collection, data processing and modelling within a pharmaceutical batch production facility. Historical energy and scheduling data have been utilized to generate a model for the site's energy profile. The approach incorporates data science and machine learning tools which pose a possible solution to the problem outlined. The results from this work can feed into an overarching goal of more sustainable manufacturing processes by allowing site energy engineers to predict and better manage plant energy load.",

This method computes the rate of change (ROC) of the system and external variables are ranked based on their correlation with the changing rate of the system to provide insight into the possible degradation mechanisms of PV modules. A data set of non-SunPower, front contacted multi-crystalline modules were analyzed with the month-by-month method. Results show an average linear ROC of -0.95%/year with an observed correlation between the ROC and the brand of the module, as well as the total age of the system, and the climate zone the system is located in.",

        "abstract": "Feature engineering is a crucial but tedious task that requires up to 80% of the total time in data science projects. A significant challenge is when data consists of tables from different data sources, thus data scientists need to wisely aggregate and join tables while performing feature engineering task. In this work, we demonstrate a novel system called OneBM (One Button Machine), that enables data scientists to increase their efficiency with automated feature engineering for relational data. OneBM takes as input a relational dataset with multiple tables and its entity relation diagram (ERD) which can be declared with a novel, easy-to-use drag-and-drop graphical user interface. The system then automatically identifies and executes relevant joins and aggregates in the data, and generates new features with a rich set of transformations for various types of data including but not limited to time-series, sequences, number sets and itemsets, etc. The generated features then can be used by automated model selection and hyper-parameter optimization algorithms to complete a fully end-to-end automated data science (or AutoDS) workflow. A follow-up user evaluation illustrated how data scientists can perform multi-table feature engineering tasks in minutes using our system, compared to repeatedly coding SQL-like queries to transform and aggregate relational data requiring weeks of manual labor for comparable performance. In the live demos we plan to show two use cases with real-world datasets (video demos are available at the links in the footnote): sale prediction1 and call center user experience2. Pre-registered partcipants can play with these use-cases and the given datasets via Watson Studio on the cloud.",

        "abstract": "currently, maintenance of clinical databases has become a crucial task in the medical field. The patient data consisting of various features and diagnostics related to disease should be entered with the utmost care to provide quality services. As the data stored in medical databases may contain missing values and redundant data, mining of the medical data becomes cumbersome. As it can affect the results of mining, it is essential to have good data preparation and data reduction before applying data mining algorithms. Prediction of disease becomes quick and easier if data is precise and consistent and free from noise. One of the key specialty of Naive Bayes classifiers is that they are highly scalable, requiring a number of parameters linear in the number of variables (features/predictors) in a learning problem. Evaluation of closed-form expression can be achieved by Maximum-likelihood training. Which requires linear time, rather than by expensive iterative approximation as used for many other types of classifiers. This research uses data science approach to diognize the medical data. In this article, a study has been conducted by using naïve Bayes classifier to classify the medical data. The suitability of the classifier and the accuracy of the classifier are measured using different performance criteria. This study is useful for researchers and developers in understanding and using a classification technique in medical diagnosis.",

Data systems enhance open science by offering forward thinking technological solutions, such as providing data and computation on the cloud, to enable collaboration, sharing and analysis. In this paper, we present our vision for a conceptual data system on the cloud that enables open science. We also present our work on the Multi-Mission Algorithm and Analysis Platform (MAAP) which has served as a pathfinder data system for this conceptual approach.",

Under the new situation of \"double first-class\" construction of national higher education, how can Local Application-oriented Universities scientifically position the talent training objectives of big data major, reasonably set up talent training programs, accurately grasp the talent demand of the industry, cultivate technical talents to meet the needs of social and economic development, and promote the sustainable development of the major according to their own teaching resources and school running conditions, It is the first problem that must be considered in the specialty construction. Taking Ordos Institute of applied technology as an example, this paper explores the talent training system of data science and big data technology major from six aspects of talent training objectives, curriculum system structure, teaching staff construction, teaching research and reform, practical teaching and school enterprise cooperation, so as to provide reference for the talent training reform and development of big data major in Application-oriented brother colleges.",

        "abstract": "Data are not only the lifeblood of the geosciences but they have become the currency of the modern world both in science and in society. Rapid advances in computing, communications, and observational technologies - along with concomitant advances in high-resolution modeling, ensemble and coupled-systems predictions of the Earth system - are revolutionizing nearly every aspect of the geosciences. Modern data volumes from high-resolution ensemble prediction systems and next-generation remote-sensing systems like hyper-spectral satellite sensors and phased-array radars are staggering. The advent and maturity of cloud computing technologies and tools have opened new avenues for addressing both big data and Open Science challenges to accelerate scientific discoveries. There is broad consensus that as data volumes grow rapidly, it is particularly important to reduce data movement and bring processing and computations to the data. Data providers also need to give scientists an ecosystem that includes data, tools, workflows and other end-to-end applications and services needed to perform analysis, integration, interpretation, and synthesis - all in the same environment or platform. Instead of moving data to processing systems near users, as is the tradition, one will need to bring processing, computing, analysis and visualization to data - so called data proximate workbench capabilities, also known as server-side processing.",

The resulting heterogeneous environments make data management operations challenging, the significant number of events and the absence of data integration makes it difficult to track data provenance, manage sophisticated analysis processes, and recover from unexpected situations. Current approaches often require costly human intervention and are inherently error prone. The difficulties inherent in managing and manipulating such large and highly distributed datasets also limits automated sharing and collaboration. We study a real world e-Science application involving terabytes of data, using three different analysis and storage platforms, and a number of applications and analysis processes. We demonstrate that using a specialized data life cycle and programming model -- Active Data -- we can easily implement global progress monitoring, and sharing, recover from unexpected events, and automate a range of tasks.",

In this experience report, we describe our firsthand experiences on open data and in the domain of marine traffic in Finland and Sweden and identified technological opportunities for novel services. We enumerate five challenges that we have encountered with the application of open data: relevant data, historical data, licensing, runtime quality, and API evolution. These challenges affect both business model and technical implementation. We discuss how these challenges could be alleviated by better governance practices for provided open APIs and data.",

There is a need to interpret and to convert such data into valuable information, enabling the discovery of knowledge as well as the development of new technologies and data products. From the Data Science research field, Visual Analytics (VA) techniques seek to support in the analysis and understanding of large datasets using statistical techniques and data mining, aided by visualization techniques. This paper demonstrates how VA techniques can be applied in Data Science projects enabling users to reason over a dataset generated by IoT devices, what we call as Data Understandability. A practical case is presented in order to provide an overview of the data management procedures and how a set of Visual Analytics tools developed in the context of The U. S. Department of Energy Atmospheric Radiation Measurement (ARM) Program are helping users to visualize and analyze the collected data from a climate sensor network spread throughout the world.",

        "abstract": "The research hereby presents an innovate practice to enhance data science education by integrating an in-house-developed stock trading platform. Students of Data Science area usually face the difficulty of understanding the complex of real-time data and sophisticated statistical indicators and models. Another difficulty is students are easy to lost interests and patience during the process of learning programming and analysis process, such as R-language. Stock market, as a huge data source and an important data disciplinary, is comparatively easy to attract student attentions. Thus, we developed an intuitive trading platform for education purpose. The platform contains three components: an exploring window, a control windows and a report window. The exploring window shows current and historical stock price trends and related indicators. Several representative stocks from different sectors can be picked and specific time frames can be assigned. The control window allows students to develop their own trading strategies. A trading strategy can be created by either intuitive way, or through single or combinations of indicators, or be built generically though plug-in R-programing module. The report window demonstrates the expected return of a stock in a specific time frame through a specific strategy. A more comprehensive report with detailed transaction information is also provided for back-testing purpose. Students are involved into the development of the software and get experience for R-programming. Preliminary version of the product has been tested and surveyed in a data science classroom. About ten junior Data Science students have practiced and provided feedback. The positive survey results show the feasibility of the approach. In the future, artificial intelligent component will be integrated into the platform.",

        "abstract": "River flooding is deemed a catastrophic phenomenon caused by extreme climate change and other ecological factors (e.g., amount of sunlight), which are difficult to predict and monitor. However, the use of the Internet of Things (IoT), various types of sensing including social sensing, 5G wireless communication, and big data analysis has devised advanced tools for early prediction and management of distrust events. To this end, this article amalgamates machine learning models and data analytics approaches along-with IoT sensor data to investigate attribute importance for the prediction of risk levels in flooding. The article presents three river levels: normal, medium, and high-risk river levels for machine learning models. Performance is evaluated with varying configurations and evaluations set up including training and testing of support vector machine and random forest using a principal-components-analysis-based dimension reduced dataset. In addition, we investigate the use of synthetic minority oversampling technique to balance the class representations within a dataset. As expected, the results indicate that a “balanced” representation of data samples achieved high accuracy (nearly 93 percent) when benchmarked with “imbalanced” data samples using random forest classifier 10-fold cross-validations.",

Data anonymization is a new technique in compliance with the Thai Personal Data Protection Act (PDPA) and cyber security. On the same token, the meaning of data analytics is also lost while we gain data privacy. This paper aims to demonstrate the effect of implementing data privacy on a data science project. A classification model is used to measure the effect of Kanonymity. A healthcare dataset is used for a demonstration. With k range from 10 to 10000, our lab result shows information loss compared to k values in the conclusion section.",

        "abstract": "Nowadays, banks grant credits so that customers can acquire a good or service, start or improve a business, among other benefits. The problems that may arise are over-indebtedness and low saving possibilities on the part of customers, so the tendency is the risk of default. Financial institutions require tools for default risk analysis and problem prediction. Therefore, in this research, a data analysis method based on data science and machine learning is proposed for bank risk prediction in credit applications for financial institutions. For the analysis process and for the prediction of a credit, predictive analysis methods are used: Genetic Algorithms (GA), Random Forest (RF), K-Nearest-Neighbor (KNN), Support Vector Machines (SVM) and Neural Network (NN). Quality metrics such as Accuracy, Precision, Recall and F1 Score are used to evaluate the results. A public dataset called Statlog [1] is used. This work opens the door for data analysis in different banking services. The main objective of this research is to help financial companies to optimize their processes.",

        "abstract": "The mission of the Multispectral Thermal Imager (MTI) satellite is to demonstrate the efficacy of highly accurate multispectral imaging for passive characterization of urban and industrial areas, as well as sites of environmental interest. The satellite makes top-of-atmosphere radiance measurements that are subsequently processed into estimates of surface properties such as vegetation health, temperatures, material composition and others. The system also provides simultaneous data for atmospheric characterization at high spatial resolution. To utilize these data the MTI science program has several coordinated components, including modeling, comprehensive ground-truth measurements, image acquisition planning, data processing and data analysis and interpretation. Algorithms have been developed to retrieve a multitude of physical quantities and these algorithms are integrated in a processing pipeline architecture that emphasizes automation, flexibility and programmability. This paper describes the MTI data products and ground processing, as well as the \"how to\" aspects of starting a data center from scratch.",

As of early December, only 19 new drugs had been approved by the Food and Drug Administration (FDA), fewer than half of those approved in 2015 and the lowest number since 2007. Further, the FDA approved only 61% of submissions in 2016, compared to 95% in 2015 [1]. And, among the largest companies, the return on investment for research and development (R&D) fell to 3.7% [2].",

Among the proposed actions of the President's Climate Action Plan are several efforts to foster the use of existing data to encourage development of additional data products and tools that can be used to improve community resilience and prepare for the impacts of climate change. Building on previous efforts to organize the presentation of this material from Federal web pages and data centers, the Climate Data Initiative is working together with other related efforts to link Earth observation systems through to data resulting from them and on to related web pages, case studies, decision making tools, and other relevant content. Often such information is not located in a single web site, data center, or even a single agency, but distributed across the Federal Government. Linking such information across the breadth of interagency holdings can increase understanding of the complexity of those holdings and their inter-relationships and allow a more cohesive presentation of all of the material.",

Meeting the scientific objectives requires demanding analysis of the data being collected and processed. Visualization tools will assist in the understanding of the data and of the effects of the various types of processing being performed. The TES visualization tools are designed to verify correct functioning; of the instrument, provide early detection of potential problems, and report on the quality and validity of the science data for drawing scientific conclusions. Visualization displays include the Level III tools for displaying the end result of all the processing, merged and georeferenced for display relative to maps or global images, and displays for characterizing the behavior of the science processing algorithms and exploring the effects of implementation decisions. Displays of interest include plots of spectra and profiles, animations showing variations in the data along spatial or temporal axes, and results of various operations on the data. Together, these tools provide a visualization suite for more rapidly analyzing the science results of the TES instrument and detecting and identifying problems in the instrument or processing system.",

        "abstract": "Geosciences data is the important basis for science research and social development. In the past decades, many countries including developed countries and developing countries paid more attention on geosciences data sharing and related e-infrastructure construction. Because geosciences data have typical multi-sources, multi-types, cross disciplines features, they haven't common data model and related benchmark. This causes lots of geosciences data can't be integrated and shared web sharing oriented. Faced to this problem, the paper analyzed geosciences data multi-dimensions features, including their disciplinary dimension, thematic dimension, spatial scale dimension, temporal dimension, application dimension, etc. Geosciences data concept model with common dimensions was designed based on case study on Data Sharing Network of Earth System Science (DSNESS), which is one of important platforms of SDSP and NSTI. Three common data benchmark of this model are researched based on the geosciences data in DSNESS, i.e., data elements dimension benchmark, spatial dimension and temporal dimension benchmark. Element dimension focuses on the element classification structure and coding system, spatial dimension is contribute to the construction of data spatial reference based on grid, temporal dimension is helpful for the construction of time serials data sets according to the frequency of data updating. The common data benchmark is used in DSNESS and has been proved useful for geosciences data integration and sharing initially.",

        "abstract": "Ocean observing systems are adding another dimension to the potential of the Internet as a science education tool. Providing a stream of detailed information from thousands of points around the globe, these systems will help scientists build a more complete understanding of the dynamic global ocean environment. In addition to their importance to primary researchers, these data are useful to others, including educators and students. How can we efficiently and effectively share this information with non-researchers? What information, and how much, will various users need and want from the continuous stream of data that the observing systems are capable of delivering? Many scientists are finding the Internet a useful tool for disseminating research information to non-scientific audiences, particularly to fulfil the \"broader impacts\" requirement. However, developing and packaging effective learning resources in any medium, especially the Internet, is challenging. A well designed science education Website should tell a coherent and interesting story that helps the user develop a greater knowledge and understanding about the subject. This result occurs as a result of thorough planning of the Website concept, content, and design, accomplished through collaboration with educators and Web designers.",

        "abstract": "This innovative practice paper outlines a design-based research study to enhance data science literacy in students using an unplugged approach. With the rapid growth of data and its impact on daily life, there's a need for new educational methods to help students understand and use data effectively. Data science involves math, statistics, computation, AI, and machine learning, but teaching these concepts can be challenging without access to computers or the internet, potentially widening educational inequities. Inspired by unplugged computer science education, this study supports data science education in unplugged classrooms. Initial research focused on creating and testing two learning units on data visualization and summarization using innovative activities and reflection prompts. Analyzing students' work from a pilot with ten eleventh-graders in a low-income public school in a Global South country, the study aims to understand how these activities support data visualization skills and identify limitations. Future work will develop and implement lesson plans to promote data and AI literacy, aiming to make data science education more inclusive across diverse backgrounds.",

Subsequently, the results of different experiments, including hyperparameter optimization on preprocessing steps and switching between different prediction targets, could be compared to manual experiments. Overall, a manually experienced model could be found to outperform hyperparameter-tuned pipelines.",

This paper aims to translate of the underlying requirements for the division of data science and big data technologies into a formal set of goal, and the level of proficiency under the Conceive-Design-Implement-Operate (CDIO) initiative’s objective. The curriculum consists of a list of syllabuses derived through a consensus process to the appropriate list of knowledge, skills and attitudes possessed by fresh engineers.",

The responses to the virus differed from country to country, which led to variable outcomes throughout. Understanding how the answer to the virus and resource availability affected the outcomes is important. In this paper, we present our work on using various data science technologies including correlation analysis, regression analysis, and exploratory data analysis to understand the relationship among different variables and factors. We also present a set of data visualization tools that consist of two types of geospatial visualization functions, standard bar chart, stacked bar chart, and line chart. These tools help users to better understand the data and to make smart decisions in policies related to response, prevention, and intervention of pandemic episodes.",

Data science (DSci) as a discipline has been appropriately traced to the concern for data quality mostly as an input to complex decision-making situations based on examination through different approaches of very large volumes of data. The emerging massive data volumes in many fields of science, including remote sensing and other scientific and technological fields have fueled a review of the tenet of data quality assessment and analyses of the types of massive data that DSci relies on. In this paper we succinctly review these data quality concerns as a basis for our projects where a variety of massive data is considered.",

While we can automate most of the activities involved in WDA, the warranty analyst performs the remaining steps manually, making the analysis time intensive. In today’s competitive environment, there is an inevitable need to efficiently analyze a large number of products in a shorter time. This paper explains how each step involved in WDA can be effectively automated using data science techniques and derive meaningful insights in real time.",

Despite these hurdles, with improved data governance and availability, a team with the right skills and outlook, and the support of senior leadership, the transition from a more traditional institutional research function to one representing a data science perspective is not only possible, but natural. The work of Harvard University's Office of Institutional Research on issues related to research output is offered as an example.",

The project emphasizes the collaboration of multidisciplinary experts, such as information engineering and network engineering, to explore the effectiveness of AI technology in enhancing Earth environmental disaster prediction models. The project particularly highlights the concepts of data reuse and model reuse, combining the data marketplace and model marketplace platforms of the NCHC to establish a national-level data service platform. Through the data marketplace platform, data reuse is achieved, encouraging cross-disciplinary collaboration and fostering innovative applications and decision-making recommendations. Simultaneously, the model marketplace platform allows AI models from Earth science sub-projects to be launched, realizing model reuse and providing a strong reference for Taiwan's disaster response decision-making system, contributing to sustainable development.",

        "abstract": "Ever since the population explosion began postmodern industrialization since 1950 the population has grown more than threefold. With the global population crossing the Benchmark of 8.0 billion in June 2022, while some nations reap the benefits of progress, there are still nations who face the challenges of a pre-industrialized world, even today there is a quarter of world Population that does not have access to safe and clean drinking water. In this paper, conventionally, treatment of water is carried out with the help of Chemical Coagulants (Primarily Alum), several research have linked the usage of Alum with Neurodegenerative Diseases like Alzheimer's. Hence the need arises to develop a suitable alternative, Seeds of Moringa Oleifera also known as miracle tree due to its Phytochemical Properties contain Mo-CBP3-4 a protein that causes adsorption and neutralization of the colloidal charges thereby clarifying the water, For high initial Turbidity waters the optimal Dosage was the same for Moringa Oleifera (50mg/l) and the sludge produced post treatment is not only innocuous but also three to four times less by volume when compared with Alum and specially we use big data for data analysis.",

        "abstract": "Remembering the discussion about the European Open Science Cloud (EOSC) and what opportunities it will provide to nations that are not member states of the European Union (EU). The Ethiopian EOSC Working Group had the vision of democratization of the access to information that pushes Ethiopian researchers closer to the international research community and offers access to raw data especially that one collected by international research teams in Ethiopia and normally stored (away) at the research coordinators' universities outside of Ethiopia. - At that time there was very little trust in data collected locally in Ethiopia by local organizations. Therefore, the use of secondary data was not on the agende and each research project started with primary data collection. Now-a-days, financial means are more restricted and researchers are more careful in the data collection process that databases can be shared and used in future research projects and by different researchers. This paper will refer to the following examples of democratization of data: (1)WorldBank Microdata for Ethiopia with its representative survey data of Ethiopian households and (2) the European Space Agency Copernicus Science Hub satellite images. Both sources are fully accessible online and can be used for Various data analytics. Bringing articles, books and data online an open access mode is the first step towards democratization of data. The knowledge and skills to use provided online information is key to enable researchers and citizens alike in becoming active players in the democratiouse of data for decision/policy making purposes.",

        "abstract": "Lack of standard metadata and file formats make it challenging to archive and distribute remote sensing data. Although the Common Data Model (CDM) developed by Unidata has the potential of providing easy access to data stored in a variety of file formats, it would still be necessary to maintain each I/O library ever used to create a data product. Moreover, due to the nature of these data structures, I/O libraries are often complicated and expensive to maintain. As a consequence, the long-term archival of data stored in multiple formats becomes an expensive and challenging task. In this paper, we demonstrate an alternative solution, namely migration of data to a single standards-based archive format. Data from NASA's Earth Observing System (EOS) Data Centers formatted in Hierarchical Data Format (HDF) are used in the demonstration.",

        "abstract": "Amid escalating global energy demand and the imperatives of enhanced energy efficiency, the incorporation of Smart Grids (SG) has emerged as a necessity. Buildings, a significant contributor to energy consumption, must evolve towards becoming “smart” through the deployment of appropriate Energy Management Systems (EMS). Central to any EMS is Energy Incident Management (EIM), an essential tool in the timely detection and alerting of potential energy incidents and faults. This paper delves deeper into the complexities of designing a real-time, energy-efficient EIM, which extracts and processes data while leveraging Machine Learning (ML) predictive analytics to forecast possible energy incidents. Our methodology harnesses principles of Data Science, whereby data from diverse sources is amassed, purified, and readied for use by the ML predictive analytics model. To implement our EIM, we embrace a Cloud-based strategy, taking advantage of existing Cloud technologies to encapsulate all phases of the Data Science process within a comprehensive, unified framework (IDE).",

NASA provides science data products that cover a wide range of physical, geophysical, biochemical and other parameters, as well as, services for interdisciplinary Earth science studies. Management and distribution of these products is administered through the Earth Observing System Data and Information System (EOSDIS) Distributed Active Archive Centers (DAACs), which all hold data within a different Earth science discipline. This work highlight selected EOS datasets and focuses on how these observations contribute to the improvement of essential services such as weather forecasting, climate prediction, air quality, and agricultural efficiency. Emphasis can be placed on new data products derived from instruments on board Terra, Aqua and ICES at as well as new regional data products and field campaigns. A variety of data tools and services are available to the user community. This work introduces primary and specialized DAAC-specific methods for finding, ordering and using these data products. Special sections focuses on orienting users unfamiliar with DAAC resources, HDF-EOS formatted data and the use of desktop research and application tools.",

        "abstract": "We present the implementation of different science mode settings and overall data flow of JUICE/RPWI instrument with focus on LP subunit. We begin with describing the reconfigurable hardware architecture and the usage of sequencers in science data acquisition. Introduction of sequencers, along with three FPGA-s, improve the subunit coordination and maximize the scientific value of collected data, especially during planned time-critical phases like icy moon flybys. 16 default sequencers and 16 default configurations per subunit can be set as active at given time, but more can be stored and loaded on-board. After the data acquisition, data processing and telemetry packing procedures are performed first by on-board software (FSW) and then unpacking with possible further processing is performed by ground segment (GS) software. Several algorithms handle LP on-board data processing, compression, organization, telemetry (TM) packing, which is sent from Data Processing Unit (DPU) using SpaceWire interface and then transferred to the ground for further processing in the GS. For certain use-cases, triggering and downlinking procedures are used. The JUICE/RPWI GS software is designed to unpack and convert custom-made instrument telemetry into Planetary Data System 4 (PDS4) compliant Common Data Format (CDF) files. The current state (TM-to-L1a) of the GS pipeline and further processing steps are described in the end.",

        "abstract": "The related problems of improving existing buildings' energy performance, reducing energy consumption, and improving indoor comfort and their many consequences are well known. Considering increasing urbanization and climate change, governments define strategies to enhance and measure buildings' energy performance and energy efficiency. This work aims to contribute to the improvement of buildings' characteristics by conducting a thorough systematic literature review and adopting a data science approach to these problems, presenting initial results with an open-access energy performance certificate dataset from the Lombardy Region, in Italy. We provide a pre-processing method to the data, applicable for future research, aiming to address challenges such as automatic classification of existing buildings' energy performance certification, and predicting energy-efficient retrofit measures, using machine learning techniques. The analysis of this dataset is challenging because of the high variability and dimensionality of this dataset. For this purpose, a robust iterative process was developed. First, the data dimensionality was reduced with Pearson Correlation to find the best set of variables against the non-renewable global energy performance index (EPgl, nren). Then, the outliers were handled by utilizing Box Plot and Isolation Forest algorithms. The main contribution is to inform private and public building sectors on dealing with high dimensional data to achieve enhanced energy performance and predict energy-efficient retrofit measures to improve their energy performance.",

        "abstract": "The ever-increasing scale of scientific data has become a significant challenge for researchers that rely on networks to interact with remote computing systems and transfer results to collaborators worldwide. Despite the availability of high-capacity connections, scientists struggle with inadequate cyberinfrastructure that cripples data transfer performance, and impedes scientific progress. The Science DMZ paradigm comprises a proven set of network design patterns that collectively address these problems for scientists. We explain the Science DMZ model, including network architecture, system configuration, cybersecurity, and performance tools, that creates an optimized network environment for science. We describe use cases from universities, supercomputing centers and research laboratories, highlighting the effectiveness of the Science DMZ model in diverse operational settings. In all, the Science DMZ model is a solid platform that supports any science workflow, and flexibly accommodates emerging network technologies. As a result, the Science DMZ vastly improves collaboration, accelerating scientific discovery.",

In addition to supporting this natural science objective, the Citizen Sort platform will also support information science research goals on motivation for participation in social-computation and citizen science. In particular, this research program addresses the use of games to motivate participation in social-computational citizen science, and explores the effects of system design on motivation and data quality. A design science approach, where IT artifacts are developed to solve problems and answer research questions is described. Research questions, progress on Citizen Sort planning and implementation, and key challenges are discussed.",

        "abstract": "As we are living in a global environment, it is not unusual to have more than one languages or dialects used in a country. Examples include Canada in the Americas, Singapore in Asia, and Switzerland in Europe. With the initiatives of globalization, many people immigrate or live in a country other than their birthplace. As a result, different people in the same country may have different home language (i.e., first language). For instance, as a nation composed of a highly diverse language population, Canada provides a unique opportunity to study the factors causing certain languages (or families of language) to be lost over subsequent generations among allophones (i.e., people whose mother tongue is neither English or French). In this paper, we focus on census data analytics. Specifically, we analyze census microdata by exploring machine learning and data mining techniques-such as decision tree induction, random forest, and categorical naive Bayes-to study the influence of various social and economic factors on the probability that allophones adopt official languages as their language spoken at home. This study is a showcase where natural sciences and engineering (NSE) meet social sciences, in which NSE solutions (e.g., census data analytics) are applicable for the study of social science related phenomena (e.g., successful detection of shifts in home languages).",

By incorporating numerous disciplinary perspectives and relying heavily on domain knowledge and expertise, data science has emerged as an important new area that integrates statistics with computational knowledge, data collection, cleaning and processing, analysis methods, and visualization to produce actionable insights from big data. As a discipline to use within Web science research, data science offers significant opportunities for uncovering trends in large Web-based datasets. A Web science observatory exemplifies this relationship by offering an online platform of tools for carrying out Web science research, allowing users to carry out data science techniques to produce insights into Web science issues such as community development, online behavior, and information propagation. The authors outline the similarities and differences of these two growing subject areas to demonstrate the important relationship developing between them.",

The goal of the OSDC is to provide petabyte-scale data cloud infrastructure and related services for scientists working with large quantities of data. Currently, the OSDC consists of more than 2000 cores and 2 PB of storage distributed across four data centers connected by 10G networks. We discuss some of the lessons learned during the past three years of operation and describe the software stacks used in the OSDC. We also describe some of the research projects in biology, the earth sciences, and social sciences enabled by the OSDC.",

        "abstract": "The emergence of abstract sciences as a counterpart of classic concrete sciences is presented in this work. The framework of abstract sciences encompasses data, information, knowledge, and intelligence sciences from the bottom up. It is found that intelligence is the ultimate level of cognitive objects generated in human brains aggregated from data (sensory), information (cognition), and knowledge (comprehension). However, there is a lack of rigorous studies and coherent theories towards the theoretical framework of abstract sciences as the counterpart of classical concrete sciences. This paper explores the cognitive and mathematical models of abstract mental objects in the brain. The taxonomy and cognitive foundations of them are explored. A set of mathematical models of data, information, knowledge, and intelligence is formally created in intelligent mathematics. Based on the cognitive and mathematical models of the cognitive objects, formal properties and relationship of contemporary data, information, knowledge, and intelligence sciences are rigorously explained.",

The data space concept, i.e., a digital ecosystem promoting sustainable and findability, accessibility, interoperability, and reusability data use, has emerged to address key challenges. This article introduces the European Network for Earth System Modelling Data Space, a domain-specific implementation for climate scientists within the European Open Science Cloud. This integrated environment offers datasets, tools, and services for data science applications. We present the motivations, architecture, and a scientific application example demonstrating the data space’s capabilities.",

        "abstract": "Sustainability Sciences Studies is an interdisciplinary approach towards understanding how to develop a culture of conservation. This culture of conservation can be viewed from many different aspects, from the individual person's decisions to larger community's impacts. In all of this, we see large quantities of data in a push-pull relationship with each other, with stakeholders needing to have access to real-time generated data sets and analytics from populations as large as a metropolitan community and be able to respond to as well as disseminate information to these populations. In this paper, we present a survey of the literature in these areas. The pervasive and diverse nature of big data in these fields demonstrates the need for data scientists to collaborate to identify ways to address the common and disparate needs that different projects may have in relation to big data. We also briefly present a platform and implementation the Sustainability Studies Mobile Toolkit (SSMT) and Geotagger that seek to address some of these needs.",

        "abstract": "Modern materials science research problems present a challenge to data science and analytics as experiments generate Petabyte-scale spatiotemporal datasets that span a number of modalities and formats. Creating computing infrastructure and frameworks that support the scale and diversity of materials science data while remaining accessible for materials scientists to use is a non-trivial task. We have developed the Common Research Analytics and Data Lifecycle Environment (CRADLE) to solve the challenges of materials data science through a scalable research computing framework and cyber infrastructure that can (1) handle large-scale, heterogeneous datasets (2) provide a flexible toolbox for building machine learning pipelines that span from ingestion to model deployment (3) be accessible to research scientists with limited to extensive computational backgrounds and (4) utilize a myriad of low performance to high performance computer systems. CRADLE is a framework that integrates distributed systems like Hadoop and High-Performance Computing (HPC) infras-tructure to handle materials data at scale. This all enables the general materials data scientist to query Petabytes of data and train thousands of models in a parallel, distributed environment. We demonstrate three use cases for CRADLE to benchmark its capability to ingest and analyze spatiotemporal materials data at scale. These tasks span three data modalities: transforming 2.6 billion Photovoltaic time-series power measurements, training hundreds of deep learning models on Atomic Force Microscopy images, and ingesting 27 billion geospatial data points. CRADLE exemplifies an overarching framework that accelerates time to science, extends to other domains with similar challenges, and expands the horizon of data science and research.",

        "abstract": "As a fast-growing field with widespread impact on economy and its promising hiring potential, Data Science has been enthusiastically sought-out by many disciplines in the academia, including Mathematics, Statistics, Library Science, Management Information Systems, as well as Computer Science, as an attracting area for recruiting students, soliciting grants, and expanding their existing programs. Although some standalone programs in Data Science have been established around the country, many institutions encounter the challenges in balancing the curricula among different disciplines, allocating new resources, and cooperating with the existing majors regarding enrollment management, student advising, and faculty preparation. In this paper, a strategy-based framework is proposed for those who have limited resources of all kinds to introduce Data Science through their existing Computer Science programs at a baccalaureate level with a minimum curriculum disruption. Instead of a standalone program, to embed Data Science into Computer Science education is demonstrated to be a practical, effective, cost-saving approach based on an extensive study of the synergy between Data Science and Computer Science education. While the proposed framework is not a one-size-fits-all approach, it provides a doable route for blending Data Science into Computer Science education in systematic ways. It has become the consensus that an adequate exposure to Data Science will better prepare computer science students for taking the challenges in this ever-changing, data embraced world.",

        "abstract": "With limited time in the school day to meet required state-level objectives across subjects, it is challenging to meet the need to address declining physical activity levels and to incorporate additional computer science instruction in elementary schools. Project moveSMART uses a web-based platform to integrate opportunities for physical education with computer science and computational thinking (CS/CT) learning activities. Fourth grade students who underwent a single-day intervention experienced a significant improvement in their interest in coding and their perceptions of coders. This paper presents a series of three new lessons in the fifth grade moveSMART curriculum that allow students to create and improve a physical activity monitor. We employ a project-based learning approach to expose students to data analysis and machine learning in the framework of classification and pattern recognition.",

        "abstract": "The aim of our paper is to provide good practices for teaching data science to non-computer science students and find out how we can motivate female students to take MINT (Mathematics, Computer science, Natural science and Technology) classes. The analyzed data science course is offered at University of Vienna in the Business Analytics, Data Science, and Digital Humanities faculties as part of the masters' programs. In this work, we outline the course structure and present findings gained through teaching it. Moreover, we highlight the main differences between the editions of the course. Anonymous surveys, grade analysis, and student interviews, show that female students achieved the same learning outcomes as their male peers in all the terms as measured by the total score and all three sub-scores, namely the project submission, the mid-term quiz, and the final quiz. In 2020 and 2021, no significant differences could be found in student performance by their attended study program. In 2022, a difference could be found in the midterm exam; however, no significant difference could be found in the final exam and the project work, indicating that the course was able to harmonize the learners' diverse background. This suggests that the diverse learning opportunities offered in this course fit the individual needs of students of different backgrounds, which increases the accessibility of the data science field among non-computer science students. We propose the course as described in this paper as a good practice of teaching 21st century digital skills in a studentcentered way and conclude the paper with five recommendations.",

        "abstract": "Research has shown that the amount of data now available often overwhelms key functions of an information system. This situation necessitates the design of information architectures that scale to meet the challenges. The Planetary Data System, a NASA funded project, has developed an information architecture for the planetary science community that addresses this and other big science data issues noted in a National Research Council report regarding architectures for big data management and analysis and end-to-end data lifecycle management across diverse disciplines. The report identified enabling technology trends including distributed systems, service-oriented architectures, ontologies, models and information representation, scalable database systems, federated data security mechanisms, and technologies for moving big data. This paper will present the PDS4 information architecture, its successful implementation in a multi-discipline big-data environment.",

        "abstract": "This Full Paper in the Research-To-Practice Category illustrates what an online survey of students’ opinions reveals about students’ perceived learning and take-away from a course on Data Science. The course is offered at University of Vienna in the Business Analytics, Data Science, and Digital Humanities faculties as part of the masters’ programs. In this work, we outline the course structures, goals, modules, and present preliminary findings gained while teaching the course. Due to the global pandemic and resulting lock-downs, the course was held online, hence, we also analyze the effects of the current situation on the students.The results revealed that the structure of the course is appreciated by the students. Furthermore, the students liked the open source software taught in the course where they can create visual workflows with an intuitive, drag-and-drop style graphical interface, without the need for coding. The results also confirmed our hypothesis which showed that working in groups is more complex and difficult using online tools. We learn that the instructor-generated technique for forming the groups assigning to each group students with different backgrounds, lead to teams that are able to solve problems faster as they are more cognitively diverse. These findings confirm that the approach used in the Data Science course is viable for teaching computer science skills to non computer-scientist and can be used by other educational institutions.",

        "abstract": "Knowledge and insight extraction from large datasets has been revolutionised by the rapid development and expansion of data science in recent years. Bibliometric analysis is an effective method for studying research tendencies, significant authors, institutions, and major areas of attention to better comprehend the development of this field as a whole. Here, employing Web of Science's massive database, we give a bibliometric study of research in data science conducted over the previous decade. We use a number of bibliometric indicators and visualisation tools to try and spot trends, new areas of study, and key players in the field. Publication output, citation patterns, cooperation networks, and research hubs are just few of the many aspects we consider in our analyses. Our goal in conducting this extensive analysis is to illuminate the most important trends that have formed the field of data science over the last decade and give novel perspectives on the discipline's history, development, and future. Researchers, practitioners, and policymakers may use this study as a starting point for thinking critically about the ever-changing environment of data science and locating promising new areas for investigation and cooperation.",

        "abstract": "Future planetary science instruments will be capable of producing far more data than can be transmitted back to Earth, potentially leaving valuable scientific data on a planet's surface. Instruments will need to carefully identify the subset of total data to be prioritized for return, as transmission of the full data volume, even after compression, will not be feasible. The concept of science autonomy, where instruments collect measurement data, perform selected science data analyses onboard, and then autonomously act upon those analyses through self-adjustment and tuning of instrument parameters, can be used to identify and produce an optimal and compact data set for return, maximizing the value of each bit returned to Earth. Furthermore, the selection of the next operation(s) to be run following preliminary measurements, without requiring ground-in-the-loop communication, increases mission efficiency and enables successful yet shorter duration missions to hazardous planetary environments. This capability allows missions to prioritize the most compelling or time-critical data, yielding a more efficient and productive scientific investigation overall. In this paper, we present our implementation using different machine learning (ML) techniques (i.e., clustering, classification) for analyzing science data from the Mars Organic Molecule Analyzer (MOMA) instrument onboard the ExoMars rover Rosalind Franklin. MOMA is a dual-source (laser desorption and gas chromatography) mass spectrometer that will search for past or present life on the Martian surface and subsurface through analysis of soil samples. We use data collected from the MOMA flight-like engineering model to develop mass-spectrometry-focused ML techniques. This effort, in preparation for operating on Mars, is aimed at 1) helping the ExoMars science and operations team quickly analyze new data and support them in their decision-making process regarding subsequent operations and, 2) getting a better understanding of the challenges to enable science autonomy in future missions. We also present two significant challenges we faced in this development that are particular to space missions and will be common to most, if not all, robotic planetary missions. First, the lack of sufficient data volume from these unique and highly optimized instruments to train neural networks, and second the lack of sufficient results from the system to fully trust its output. To tackle the first challenge, we analyze the performance of ML algorithms after adding augmented data. We discuss adopting transfer learning techniques to fine-tune a NN trained on large amounts of commercial instrument data so that it can operate on our limited MOMA dataset. For the ‘trust’ challenge—as it is not always clear what we are looking for in planetary science—we must consider agile ML applications and demonstrate that these will not filter out potentially critical data. We will discuss our concept of a Trust Readiness Level for science autonomy akin to the NASA Technology Readiness Level. This initial project for advanced autonomy illustrates some key first steps of a longer-term objective to enable the spacecraft and instruments themselves to make real-time adjustments during operations as direct human oversight will not be possible for missions going further away in our solar system and beyond.",

        "abstract": "Contribution: This article discusses a research-practice partnership (RPP) where instructors from six undergraduate courses in three universities developed data science modules tailored to the needs of their respective disciplines, academic levels, and pedagogies. Background: STEM disciplines at universities are incorporating data science topics to meet employer demands for data science-savvy graduates. Integrating these topics into regular course materials can benefit students and instructors. However, instructors encounter challenges in integrating data science instruction into their course schedules. Research Questions: How did instructors from multiple engineering and science disciplines working in an RPP integrate data science into their undergraduate courses? Methodology: A multiple case study approach, with each course as a unit of analysis, was used to identify data science topics and integration approaches. Findings: Instructors designed their modules to meet specific course needs, utilizing them as primary or supplementary learning tools based on their course structure and pedagogy. They selected a subset of discipline-agnostic data science topics, such as generating and interpreting visualizations and conducting basic statistical analyses. Although instructors faced challenges due to varying data science skills of their students, they valued the control they had in integrating data science content into their courses. They were uncertain about whether the modules could be adopted for use by other instructors, specifically by those outside of their discipline, but they all believed the approach for developing and integrating data science could be adapted to student needs in different situations.",

While more data become available, we find some data analysis studies were too simplistic, while others too overwhelming in answering this challenging question. We find the approach that analyzes life expectancy related data (mortality causes and rate for different cohorts) inspiring, and use this approach to study a carefully selected set of targets for comparison. In discussing the factors that matter, we argue that it is more reasonable to try to identify a set of factors that together explain the phenomenon.",

        "abstract": "One of the key problems of modern cognitive research is the development of methods for unbiased assessment of people’s personality traits. The methods of personality questionnaires traditional for psychology in some cases give inadequate assessments that arise as a result of the respondent’s unwillingness to truthfully answer the test questions, or his unconscious distortion of self-esteem. As an alternative, methods of implicit assessment of personality traits have been developed. One of these methods is the analysis of the characteristics of a person’s response to the emotionally colored phrases. In this study, we analyzed behavioral responses under conditions of recognition of negative emotional sentences describing aggression either of the participant or others. We have proposed a statistical analysis model that makes it possible to evaluate the personal specificity of a person’s response to the appearance of such sentences, taking into account both the semantic and grammatical features of verbal stimuli. It was shown that the usage of Data Science for processing behavioral data in terms of implicit recognition of speech emotions can be used to compile Intelligent Databases that reflect the psychological personality traits of survey participants.",

        "abstract": "Big data has emerged as a key connecting point between things and objects on the internet. In this cyber-physical space, different types of sensors interact over wireless networks, collecting data and delivering services ranging from environmental pollution monitoring, disaster management and recovery, improving the quality of life in homes, to enabling smart cities to function. However, despite the perceived benefits we are realizing from these sensors, the dawn of the Internet of Things (IoT) brings fresh challenges. Some of these have to do with designing the appropriate infrastructure to capture and store the huge amount of heterogeneous sensor data, finding practical use of the collected sensor data, and managing IoT communities in such a way that users can seamlessly search, find, and utilize their sensor data. In order to address these challenges, this paper describes an integrated IoT architecture that combines the functionalities of Service-Controlled Networking (SCN) with cloud computing. The resulting community-driven big data platform helps environmental scientists easily discover and manage data from various sensors, and share their knowledge and experience relating to air pollution impacts. Our experience in managing the platform and communities provides a proof of concept and best practice guidelines on how to manage IoT services in a data-intensive research environment.",

        "abstract": "Big data is growing as an area of information technology, service, and science, and so too is the need for its intellectual understanding and interpretation from a theoretical, philosophical, and societal perspective. The Philosophy of Big Data is the branch of philosophy concerned with the foundations, methods, and implications of big data, the definitions, meaning, conceptualization, knowledge possibilities, truth standards, and practices in situations involving very-large data sets that are big in volume, velocity, variety, veracity, and variability. The Philosophy of Big Data is evolving into a discipline at two levels, one internal to the field as a generalized articulation of the concepts, theory, and systems that comprise the overall conduct of big data science. The other is external to the field, as a consideration of the impact of big data science more broadly on individuals, society, and the world. Methods, tools, and concepts are evaluated at both the level of industry practice theory and social impact. Three aspects are considered: what might constitute a Philosophy of Big Data, how the disciplines of the Philosophy of Information and the Philosophy of Big Data are developing, and an example of the Philosophy of Big Data in application in the data-intensive science field of Synthetic Biology. Overall a Philosophy of Big Data might helpful in conceptualizing and realizing big data science as a service practice, and also in transitioning to data-rich futures with human and data entities more productively co-existing in mutual growth and collaboration.",

        "abstract": "This paper discusses an integrated methodology to structure and formalize business requirements in large data-intensive projects, e.g. data warehouses implementations, turning them into precise and unambiguous data definitions suitable to facilitate harmonization and assignment of data governance responsibilities. We place a business information model in the center - used end-to-end from analysis, design, development, testing to data quality checks by data stewards. In addition, we show that the approach is suitable beyond traditional data warehouse environments, applying it also to big data landscapes and data science initiatives - where business requirements analysis is often neglected. As proper tool support has turned out to be inevitable in many real-world settings, we also discuss software requirements and their implementation in the Accurity Glossary tool. The approach is evaluated based on a large banking data warehouse project the authors are currently involved in.",

        "abstract": "This paper presents an approach to solving the data variety problem of big data through an offline and online decisionmaking system. We present a graph-based approach to imitate real-world problem domain with a set of criteria and problem solvers. We introduce a Multi-criteria decision-making model to select a set of problem solvers that meets the set of criteria most. Suppose a system is processing Twitter data that comes as a stream of JSON records from multiple data sources. The decision system determines which of the available methods to use for a list of requirements (criteria). When multiple criteria (must meet requirements) coexist in a problem domain, their order of importance against the criteria, the mutual influence on each other and level of indispensability forms a graphic structure. In the proposed model, we consider each vertex of the graph as a criterion or benefit of an agent against the criterion. The mutual influence of multiple agents is denoted by the connecting edges of the graph. We also proposed a fuzzy graph framework to model real-world unpredictability. The model produces benchmarking results for each of the problem solvers in terms of absolute values to support decision making. The model is implemented through TopBread, Resource Description Framework (RDF), and RDF Data Query Language (RDQL). The key advantage of the proposed model over the existing ones is that the framework can operate in a dual-mode-both as a standalone offline tool and as an online decision-making gateway, it can also be used in high-velocity ingestion scenarios.",

Hence, innovations of computers, software and applications have emerged as a pressing need. Data science solutions have been designed and/or developed for social good. For example, in this paper, we present a data science solution for mining weather and transportation data. The solution helps analyze the effect of common weather conditions (e.g., fog, rain, snow) on transportation. Evaluation on real-life data for a Canadian city demonstrates the practicality of our data science solution for mining weather and transportation data. Knowledge discovered helps in building a smart city.",

As today's era is going on, we are seeing that anyone go to buy even a small thing, then first do a research on the internet, then we go to buy it. Consider that we have to go to purchase a mobile phone, now we search on the internet, according to our budget, so we get many search results, which we can say that the result is the Big Data. Now we are according to our specifications, we choose 10 phones, which is called data mining, now we shortlist the mobile phone according to the specifications, need and budget, in the end, we think to purchase a mobile phone which is called decision making. In the above example I am trying to explain the need of Data Science in today's time. Our objective in this research paper is that using data science, how can we tell a relationship with big data.

Knowledge discovery engines try to extract general inferences from facts or training data. Statistical methods take a more structured approach, attempting to quantify data by known and intuitively understood models. The problem of gleaning knowledge from existing data sources poses a significant paradigm shift from these traditional approaches. The size, noise, diversity, dimensionality, and distributed nature of typical data sets make even formal problem specification difficult. Moreover, you typically do not have control over data generation. This lack of control opens up a Pandora's box filled with issues such as overfitting, limited coverage, and missing/incorrect data with high dimensionality. Once specified, solution techniques must deal with complexity, scalability (to meaningful data sizes), and presentation. This entire process is where data mining makes its transition from serendipity to science.",

        "abstract": "The authors describe the capabilities of McIDAS , an interactive visualization system that is vastly increasing the ability of earth scientists to manage and analyze data from remote sensing instruments and numerical simulation models. McIDAS provides animated three-dimensional images and highly interactive displays. The software can manage, analyze, and visualize large data sets that span many physical variables (such as temperature, pressure, humidity, and wind speed), as well as time and three spatial dimensions. The McIDAS system manages data from at least 100 different sources. The data management tools consist of data structures for storing different data types in files, libraries of routines for accessing these data structures, system commands for performing housekeeping functions on the data files, and reformatting programs for converting external data to the system's data structures. The McIDAS tools for three-dimensional visualization of meteorological data run on an IBM mainframe and can load up to 128-frame animation sequences into the workstations. A highly interactive version of the system can provide an interactive window into data sets containing tens of millions of points produced by numerical models and remote sensing instruments. The visualizations are being used for teaching as well as by scientists.\u003C\u003E",

        "abstract": "BepiColombo's Mercury orbiter radio science experiment (MORE) was conceived to enable extremely accurate radio tracking measurements of the Mercury Planetary Orbiter to precisely determine the gravity field and the rotational state of Mercury, and to test theories of gravitation (e.g., Einstein's theory of general relativity). The design accuracy of the radio tracking data was 0.004 mm/s (at 1000 s integration time) for the range-rate measurements and 20 cm for the range (at a few seconds of the integration time). These accuracies are attained due to a combination of simultaneous two-way microwave links at X (7.2-8.4 GHz) and Ka-band (32-34 GHz) to calibrate the dispersive plasma noise component. In this letter, we present the first analysis of the range and range-rate data collected by ESA's deep-space antenna (DSA) during the initial cruise phase of BepiColombo. The novel 24 Mcps pseudonoise (PN) modulation of the Ka-band carrier, enabled by MORE's Ka-band transponder, built by Thales Alenia Space Italy, Rome, Italy, provided two-way range measurements to the centimeter-level accuracy, with an integration time of 4.2 s at 0.29 astronomical units. In tracking passes with favorable weather conditions, the range-rate measurements attained an average accuracy of 0.01 mm/s at 60 s integration time. Data from May 20-24, 2019 were combined in a multi-pass analysis to test the link stability on a longer timescale. The results confirm the noise level observed with the single-pass analysis and provide a preliminary indication that the MORE PN ranging system at 24 Mcps is compatible with the realization of an absolute measurement, where the need to introduce the range biases in the orbital fit is much more limited than in the past. We show that in the initial cruise test the BepiColombo radio link provided the range measurements of unprecedented accuracy for a planetary mission, and that, in general, all target accuracies for radio-metric measurements were exceeded.",

In this paper, we present, “Milo”, a web-based visual programming environment for Data Science Education, designed as a pedagogical tool that can be used by students without prior-programming experience. To that end, Milo uses graphical blocks as abstractions of language specific implementations of Data Science and Machine Learning(ML) concepts along with creation of interactive visualizations. Using block definitions created by a user, Milo generates equivalent source code in JavaScript to run entirely in the browser. Based on a preliminary user study with a focus group of undergraduate computer science students, Milo succeeds as an effective tool for novice learners in the field of Data Science.",

        "abstract": "The popularity of Python programming language has surged in recent years due to its increasing usage in Data Science. The availability of Python repositories in Github presents an opportunity for mining software repository research, e.g., suggesting the best practices in developing Data Science applications, identifying bug-patterns, recommending code enhancements, etc. To enable this research, we have created a new dataset that includes 1,558 mature Github projects that develop Python software for Data Science tasks. By analyzing the metadata and code, we have included the projects in our dataset which use a diverse set of machine learning libraries and managed by a variety of users and organizations. The dataset is made publicly available through Boa infrastructure both as a collection of raw projects as well as in a processed form that could be used for performing large scale analysis using Boa language. We also present two initial applications to demonstrate the potential of the dataset that could be leveraged by the community.",

The course is designed to cover major concepts that are useful to understand the benefits of parallel and distributed programming while not relying on a programming background. These key concepts focus more on algorithmic aspects rather than architecture and performance issues. A key aspect of our work is the use of workflows to illustrate key concepts and to allow the students to practice.",

        "abstract": "With the facility of email being accessible to any individual with an internet connection, the proliferation of spam emails is one of the biggest problems which plagues our globally integrated communication systems. The various solutions to filter and hide spam previously included the manual detection of specific keywords and the blacklisting of certain domains created to send spam. However, these methods have certain shortcomings in classifying whether emails are spam or ham. This proposed system attempts to use machine learning techniques to detect a pattern of repetitive keywords which are classified as spam. The system also proposes the classification of emails based on other various parameters contained in their structure such as Cc/Bcc, domain and header. Each parameter would be considered as a feature when applying it to the machine learning algorithm. The machine learning model will be a pre-trained model with a feedback mechanism to distinguish between a proper output and an ambiguous output. This method provides an alternative architecture by which a spam filter can be implemented.",

        "abstract": "This paper is the attempt to make the heart disease prediction at very early stage. As it is well known fact that most of the death causing disease all over the world is heart disease then comes cancer which is also very chronic and dangerous disease which has haunted the human being all over the globe. This disease and problem do not occur all of a sudden. Scientist and Doctors reveals that it is a continues process and is the result of being on a particular lifestyle for long time and also results after giving some basic and common symptoms being occurring all of a sudden. Eventually what does happen in the heart attacks is, the heart is not able to pump the required amount of blood to the parts of the body and more over it itself also does not get enough blood supply due to blocked arteries in the heart chambers there, for it results in heart failure and deaths. This paper brings the concepts of data science and its algorithms to make a hybrid model which can predict the disease of heart in the patient in comfortable ample of time advance. Moreover, the system must suggest useful and precautionary steps to the patient which are of globally accepted standards well in advance. The hybrid model is to predict and suggest the heart patient with world class heart solutions made with the help of data science algorithms namely Naïve Bayes, ANN, SVM and Hybrid Naïve Bayes, SVM, and ANN. The Accuracy, specificity, and sensitivity of Naïve Bayes, ANN, SVM and Hybrid Naïve Bayes, SVM, and ANN has been measured. The results nearly 2% increase in the accuracy in predicting the heart disease in hybrid model. Hybrid model also shows higher specificity and sensitivity by having 82.11% and 91.47 % respectively. This paper also considers different attributes and has shown positivity in the connections with the heart disease like genetics, physical activity, total fat consumption, stress and working conditions. This research shows new direction to the research area where these concepts can be applied to the smart devices, data science to revolutionize the heart disease diagnosis and cures. This project can be effective to the make awareness of the complexities of the heart disease.",

This disease has become one of the major public health concerns worldwide. It is insidious, often recognizable only by laboratory abnormalities until its latest stages. The main motive of this work is to ascertain the existence of chronic kidney disease by imposing various classification algorithms on the patient medical record. This research work is primarily concentrated on finding the best suitable classification algorithm which can be used for the diagnosis of CKD based on the classification report and performance factors. Empirical work is performed on different algorithms like Support Vector Machine, Random Forest, XGBoost, Logistic Regression, Neural networks, Naive Bayes Classifier. The experimental results show that Random Forest and XGBoost give better results when compared to other classification algorithms and generates 99.29% accuracy.",

        "abstract": "Previous to the Pioneer Venus Orbiter mission, occultation radio science data were generated at the Deep Space Stations of NASA's Deep Space Network via the analog recording of the baseband frequency output signal of a relatively wide bandwidth open-loop receiver. Signal digitization was a separate and subsequent operation at the Jet Propulsion Laboratory. During Pioneer Venus Orbiter radio science operations, the open-loop receiver baseband frequency output signal bandwidth was substantially reduced. This was made possible by programming the open-loop receiver first local oscillator with the predicted Doppler frequency profile. In addition, the receiver output signal was digitized and recorded directly on computer compatible magnetic tape in real time. Initial results obtained with this new process, referred to as \"real-time bandwidth reduction,\" during the prime Pioneer Venus Orbiter mission, compare very favorably to results obtained with the previous occultation system.",

        "abstract": "Corporate governance and the roles and responsibilities of the corporate officers and the board of directors have received an increasing interest since the Enron scandal of the early 2000s. This scandal resulted in enacting policies, laws and regulations such as the Sarbanes-Oxley and others. More recently, with almost every corporation focusing on the applications of Artificial Intelligence (AI) and Data Science (DS) for their businesses in numerous industries including finance and banking, healthcare and medicine, manufacturing and retail and defense and intelligence, it is critical that these corporations take a serious look at the roles and responsibilities of the corporate officers and the board with respect to the governance of the AI and DS operations. This paper discusses the issues and challenges for AI and DS governance with an emphasis on the potential roles and responsibilities of the corporate officers and the board of directors.",

It has been research yet the notion about data science review publication which showed the big picture using data from all countries. This research aims to study the position of the international publication map of data science indexed by Scopus using scientometric review. Scientometric methods and analyzed research data was used to analyze search results service from Scopus and the VOSviewer application. The research data of 5,202 documents published from 1983 to 2019 were obtained from the Scopus database. Most countries, subject areas, and type documents in data science publications were the United States, computer science; and conference paper. There were ten collaborative researchers' group patterns. This research proposes a convergence axis classification consisting of data science publication to characterize the body of knowledge generated from three decades of publication: Machine learning, Organism, Data mining, and Data analysis, abbreviated as MODD themes.",

        "abstract": "Ensemble simulations are a promising technique for identifying the signal of atmospheric response to extra-tropical sea surface temperature variability with high statistical significance. The basic idea is to perform multiple simulations from slightly different initial conditions and then to study the average signal of the ensemble. A significant obstacle to performing such ensemble simulations is the bookkeeping required to prepare, execute, and track the progress of hundreds of different computations. We describe an ensemble simulation experiment in which the Fast Ocean Atmosphere Model was run on the U.S. TeraGrid. In this experiment, we used the GriPhyN Virtual Data System to manage our ensemble simulations and their execution on distributed resources, achieving dramatic (order-of-magnitude) reductions in turnaround time relative to previous manual experiments.",

However, current research and applications are disconnected information islands. We propose a generally applicable pipeline for designing, programming, and evaluating the algorithmic trading of stock and crypto assets. Moreover, we demonstrate how our data science pipeline works with respect to four conventional algorithms: the moving average crossover, volume-weighted average price, sentiment analysis, and statistical arbitrage algorithms. Our study offers a systematic way to program, evaluate, and compare different trading strategies. Furthermore, we implement our algorithms through object-oriented programming in Python3, which serves as open-source software for future academic research and applications.",

The procedure of mathematically modeling a physical system is complex and involves three fundamental entities: the experimental data, a set of candidate models, and rules for determining in such a set the \"best\" model that reproduces the measured data. The construction of the candidate models is domain dependent and based on specific knowledge and techniques of the application domain. The choice of the best model is guided by the data themselves; a first rough guess is refined through system identification techniques so that the quantitative properties of the observed behavior are assessed. Automating such a procedure requires handling and integrating different formalisms and methods, both qualitative and quantitative. The paper describes a comprehensive environment that aims at the automated formulation of an accurate quantitative model of the mechanical behavior of an actual viscoelastic material in accordance with the observed response of the material to standard experiments. Algorithms and methods for both the generation of an exhaustive library of models of ideal materials and the selection of the most \"accurate\" model of a real material have been designed and implemented. The model selection phase occurs in two main stages: first the subset of most plausible candidate models for the material is drawn from the library; then, the most accurate model of the material is identified by using both statistical and numerical methods.",

Similarity search finds objects in a collection close to a given query according to some definition of sameness. Objects can be data series, text, multimedia, graphs, database tables or deep network embeddings. In this tutorial, we revisit the similarity search problem in light of the recent advances in the field and the new big data landscape. We discuss key data science applications that require efficient high-dimensional similarity search, we survey the state-of-the-art high-dimensional similarity search approaches and share surprising insights about their strengths and weaknesses, and we discuss the challenges and open research problems in this area.",

This research paper used an open data obtained from the NHS database to determine the factors that may lead to missed appointments and create a model that can be used to predict the likelihood of a patient missing an appointment. Logistic regression models and bivariate analysis were used to determine whether there was a meaningful relationship/association between \"did not attend\" and forgetfulness, gender, apathy, and transportation. An extensive literature review was conducted to narrow down the reasons that might lead to missed appointments. In conclusion, the research showed there was a significant difference between gender, type of clinic and apathy in organizations.",

This study was conducted by defining in high level the concept of data science as well as its main components. Supported in those elements, we identified the main trends. We used mainly data from google trends to determine the evolution of search by topics., research area, or simple expressions. It allowed us to reckon that artificial intelligence (AI)suffered a lack of interest until 2012. Then it became an increasingly popular field since 2014. This is due to the progression of machine learning and data science. Results show a cumulative search of data science since 2012.",

        "abstract": "This paper analyzes the presentation of the machine learning algorithm, linear regression for prediction of global temperature and carbon emissions from previous years collected data over India. The forecast of long-term global warming and weather conditions could be of huge significance in various fields, such as climate research, farming, electricity, medicine, and many more. The data is calculated and predicted by linear regression since, of all the techniques that can be used, it obtains the highest precision for global warming and temperature. First ever step is to design a consistent, effective, reliable statistical data model on a broad data set and ultimately bring the relationship between average annual temperature and contributing factors to global warming. Global temperature reduction will benefit the entire globe because not only Humans but also various animals suffer from global warming.",

The study consisted of a survey of 109 industry professionals, as well as an evaluation of relevant framework terms searched at Google. Overall, CRISP-DM was the most commonly used framework, with Scrum and Kanban being the second and third most frequently used. We note that CRISP-DM is a life cycle framework, whereas Scrum and Kanban are team coordination frameworks. Hence, this research also notes the potential demand for a framework that integrates both life cycle and team coordination aspects of leading a data science project.",

Content: In the age of big data, data science (the knowledge of deriving meaningful outcomes from data) is an essential skill that should be equipped by software engineers. It can be used to predict useful information on new projects based on completed projects. This tutorial offers core insights about the state-of-the-art in this important field. What participants will learn: Before data science: this tutorial discusses the tasks needed to deploy machine-learning algorithms to organizations (Part 1: Organization Issues). During data science: from discretization to clustering to dichotomization and statistical analysis. And the rest: When local data is scarce, we show how to adapt data from other organizations to local problems. When privacy concerns block access, we show how to privatize data while still being able to mine it. When working with data of dubious quality, we show how to prune spurious information. When data or models seem too complex, we show how to simplify data mining results. When data is too scarce to support intricate models, we show methods for generating predictions. When the world changes, and old models need to be updated, we show how to handle those updates. When the effect is too complex for one model, we show how to reason across ensembles of models. Pre-requisites: This tutorial makes minimal use of maths of advanced algorithms and would be understandable by developers and technical managers.",

        "abstract": "Noise is generally referred to as something undesirable. For example, in measurement science noise is considered a disturbance that makes measured data unclear. When an engineer tries to understand the data, data processing techniques - which are focused on minimizing the effects of noise - are often applied to the data to extract the true signal. The basic idea behind such a process is that noise is a nuisance which should be filtered out or removed. However, useful information may be influenced or destroyed with the weakening of noise. On the other hand, researchers have found that adding an appropriate amount of noise can facilitate signal detection in a noisy environment [1], [2]. In this two part tutorial, we introduce two noise-assisted data processing techniques: stochastic resonance (SR) [1] in Part One and ensemble empirical mode decomposition (EEMD) [2] in Part Two. We show their real-world applications in signal detection.",

        "abstract": "Crime Tracking System (CTS) aims to facilitate the process by automating data entry, storage, and retrieval using a mobile interface and a database to efficiently store said data. Crime investigation plays a significant role in keeping the modern cities safe. The emergence of the field of data science has opened new doors that have high potential in facilitating the process of criminal investigation. Data science enables criminal investigators to create tangible and quantifiable information on criminal social network profiles then analyzes crime concurrence based on location proximity. Aiming at availing the relevance of integrating data science analysis techniques in the criminal investigation, this study examines the suitability of cluster graphs and geolocation proximity (through heat maps) as two of the data science analysis techniques to facilitate criminal investigation process. On one hand, cluster graph analyses the social network of a suspect and examines its centrality, parallel betweenness and community affiliation. On the other hand, geolocation proximity provides an investigator with previous crime occurrences through the use of the heat map visualizing technique. These concepts are tested by embedding them in a mobile application developed to facilitate investigation process. The findings of this study demonstrate that the integration of data science and investigation activities is feasible and can extend the investigation process beyond the scope of the police profile structured database based on manual interrogation activities. This study ends by concluding the limitations and future research directions.",

        "abstract": "Heart disease refers to a condition where the blood vessels are blocked and the heart stops functioning. Many of the researches are concluded that this disease has become number one cause of death cases. It is alarmed that abnormalities can only be detected and recognized in its last stages. However it is curable if the person detects the disease earlier. The goal of this paper is to develop a data science framework which addresses the how to discover the chances of existence of heart disease by applying different classification algorithms, influence and distribution of various parameters are playing major role in disease prediction along with visualizations on Cleveland cardiovascular medical records. To minimize the diagnostic error caused by the complexity of visual and subjective interpretation. This work majorly aims to find the optimal classification algorithm on the heart disease affected health records and majorly influencing parameters. This can be used for predicting the heart disease on the classification reports. This experimental work focuses on the performance of the system was tested and classified by various algorithms such as Random Forest, Vector support, Logistic regression and XG-Boost for building the heart disease prediction model and evaluates the performance of the model.",

The development of medical imaging opened up the possibility for accurate, patient specific planning, and advanced imaging techniques provided the ground for the development of real-time navigation systems. The advancement of minimally invasive surgical techniques and tools required increasing manuality from the surgeon, which facilitated the development of tele-robotic manipulation. These systems provide a vast amount of objective inta-operative data, thus many believe that the next step could be big data analysis for creating and evaluating surgical process models. This emerging field of medicine, called Surgical Data Science, has the potential to improve intervetional medicine with objective statistical analysis, and therefore to provide better patient outcomes and a reduction in healthcare costs.",

SINET5 has more than 50 backbone routers and forms a fully meshed topology by using MPLS-TP systems to provide researchers in every Japanese prefecture with 100-Gbps access, minimized-latency, and SDN-friendly environments. SINET5 gives a multi-layer, dynamically configurable, and performance-tunable platform for a wide range of network applications including inter-cloud services. The multi-layer network design, new functions including SDN and cloud-oriented functions, and field test results on performance and reliability are reported.",

Mainly in the professional life, where the production of data is addressed and aimed at achieving a series of objectives, and in social and personal life where the production of data, direct and indirect, is equally important although not always clearly identifiable. Always and in any case, the representation of our actions in digital contents or the analysis of our behaviour as consumers, just to give two examples, are a common denominator of our relationship with the digital framework which has a direct impact at the level of relationship with companies or with public administrations. In the business, the most appropriate example today is that of Industry 4.0 which with the virtualization of the processes and products themselves is allowing companies to explore novel paradigms of innovation that were once unthinkable.",

This specifically holds for modern software development, where data science facilitates analyzing product, process, and usage and thus managing evolution and performance. With the convergence of embedded and IT domains, such as the Internet of Things (IoT) and automotive systems, software systems are becoming more complex. Complexity has two faces. On one hand it means more functionality and fluid delivery models, thus offering markets more value, such as the ability to deliver a single-customer focus. Complexity, however, also means the growth of technical debt, which slows productivity and lowers quality. As software engineering generates ever larger and more varied data sets, such as feature usage, code analysis, test coverage, error logs, and maintenance data, companies face the challenge of unlocking the value of that data.",

        "abstract": "One barrier to research at the boundaries of the traditional Earth sciences is a lack of interoperability among data systems employed in the traditional subdisciplines. Solid Earth scientists (including the hydrology community) have tended to view their datasets as descriptions of discrete objects with attributes that can be stored and manipulated conveniently in a database. Geographic Information Systems (GIS) work well in this environment. On the other hand, the oceanographic and atmospheric sciences (the Fluid Earth Sciences or FES) communities think of data as discrete points in a continuous mathematical function space where the behavior of multiple parameters in space and time is governed by a set of equations.",

        "abstract": "The Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) is a 36 band instrument (400-1400 nm) with spatial resolutions from 250 meters to 1 kilometer. The first MODIS instrument was launched on the EOS Terra spacecraft in December of 1999. The second is scheduled to launch on the EOS Aqua spacecraft in late 2001. Each MODIS instrument will produce 70 GB of raw data per day from which 390 GB of calibrated and Earth-located radiance products (Level I products) and 450 GB of higher-level science products will be archived and distributed to the public. During the EOS Terra and Aqua missions MODIS data production will ramp-up from today's 710 GB/day to 7790 GB/day in 2003. MODIS science products are produced by the MODIS Adaptive Processing System (MODAPS) from calibrated radiance and Earth-locations produced at the Goddard Distributed Active Archive Center (DAAC). The products are shipped to the MODIS Science Team for quality assurance and to DAACs for distribution to the public. On February 24, 2000 the first MODIS image of the Earth was acquired and processed. The emphasis was on getting all MODIS science products released to the public as soon as a satisfactory level of quality was achieved. After 13 months and over 250 changes to the science software, all MODIS products are being distributed to the public. The at-launch MODIS processing system, MODAPS V1, was used to produce and distribute 250GB/day of MODIS products through February 2001.",
