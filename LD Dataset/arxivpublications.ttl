paper proposes a framework for logging and understanding incremental code
executions in Jupyter notebooks. This framework aims to allow reasoning about
how insights are generated in data science and extract key observations into
best data science practices in the wild. In this paper, we show an early
prototype of this framework and ran an experiment to log a machine learning

dc:title "Data Ecofeminism";
dc:description """  Generative Artificial Intelligence (GenAI) is driving significant
environmental impacts. The rapid development and deployment of increasingly
larger algorithmic models capable of analysing vast amounts of data are
contributing to rising carbon emissions, water withdrawal, and waste
generation. Generative models often consume substantially more energy than
traditional models, with major tech firms increasingly turning to nuclear power
to sustain these systems -- an approach that could have profound environmental
consequences.
  This paper introduces seven data ecofeminist principles delineating a pathway
for developing technological alternatives of eco-societal transformations
within the AI research context. Rooted in data feminism and ecofeminist
frameworks, which interrogate about the historical and social construction of
epistemologies underlying the hegemonic development of science and technology
that disrupt communities and nature, these principles emphasise the integration
of social and environmental justice within a critical AI agenda. The paper
calls for an urgent reassessment of the GenAI innovation race, advocating for
ecofeminist algorithmic and infrastructural projects that prioritise and
respect life, the people, and the planet.

dc:title "Data Smashing";
dc:description """  Investigation of the underlying physics or biology from empirical data
requires a quantifiable notion of similarity - when do two observed data sets
indicate nearly identical generating processes, and when they do not. The
discriminating characteristics to look for in data is often determined by
heuristics designed by experts, $e.g.$, distinct shapes of \"folded\" lightcurves
may be used as \"features\" to classify variable stars, while determination of
pathological brain states might require a Fourier analysis of brainwave
activity. Finding good features is non-trivial. Here, we propose a universal
solution to this problem: we delineate a principle for quantifying similarity
between sources of arbitrary data streams, without a priori knowledge, features
or training. We uncover an algebraic structure on a space of symbolic models
for quantized data, and show that such stochastic generators may be added and
uniquely inverted; and that a model and its inverse always sum to the generator
of flat white noise. Therefore, every data stream has an anti-stream: data
generated by the inverse model. Similarity between two streams, then, is the
degree to which one, when summed to the other's anti-stream, mutually
annihilates all statistical structure to noise. We call this data smashing. We
present diverse applications, including disambiguation of brainwaves pertaining
to epileptic seizures, detection of anomalous cardiac rhythms, and
classification of astronomical objects from raw photometry. In our examples,
the data smashing principle, without access to any domain knowledge, meets or
exceeds the performance of specialized algorithms tuned by domain experts.

projects of the scientific domain or business domain. CERN Project, Scientific
Institutes, companies like Walmart, Google, Apple, among others, need data to
present their results and make predictions in the competitive data world. Data
and Science are words that together culminated in a globally recognized term
called Data Science. Data Science is in its initial phase, possibly being part
of formal sciences and also being presented as part of applied sciences,
capable of generating value and supporting decision making. Data Science
considers science and, consequently, the scientific method to promote decision
making through data intelligence. In many cases, the application of the method
(or part of it) is considered in Data Science projects in scientific domain
(social sciences, bioinformatics, geospatial projects) or business domain
(finance, logistic, retail), among others. In this sense, this article
addresses the perspectives of Data Science as a multidisciplinary area,
considering science and the scientific method, and its formal structure which
integrate Statistics, Computer Science, and Business Science, also taking into
account Artificial Intelligence, emphasizing Machine Learning, among others.
The article also deals with the perspective of applied Data Science, since Data
Science is used for generating value through scientific and business projects.
Data Science persona is also discussed in the article, concerning the education
of Data Science professionals and its corresponding profiles, since its
projection changes the field of data in the world.

wide array of activities which borrow from many other established fields of
study. Having such a vague characterization of a field in the early stages
might be natural, but over time maintaining such a broad definition becomes
unwieldy and impedes progress. In particular, the teaching of data science is
hampered by the seeming need to cover many different points of interest. Data
scientists must ultimately identify the core of the field by determining what
makes the field unique and what it means to develop new knowledge in data
science. In this review we attempt to distill some core ideas from data science
by focusing on the iterative process of data analysis and develop some
generalizations from past experience. Generalizations of this nature could form
the basis of a theory of data science and would serve to unify and scale the
teaching of data science to large audiences.
